    <p>
      I’m among the oldest millennials, recently turning 44, and now living
      through the ‘sandwich generation’—caring for aging parents while raising
      children. My mother lives on Social Security, her only income after a
      lifetime of work. My twin brother is fighting cancer and relies on
      disability benefits. This isn’t abstract policy for me. It’s survival.
    </p>
    <p>

        >Social security is known by many as the third rail of American
        politics</a
      >
      because it's seen as untouchable – but Elon is touching it—not through
      policy, but through ideology. He’s amplifying contempt for the systems
      that keep people afloat, and his platforms are echo chambers for those who
      see Social Security not as a promise, but as a problem to be solved
      through chaos.
    </p>
    <p>
      As part of Elon's DOGE initiative, Trump announced intentions to cut staff
      in the already understaffed department by 7,000 employees. They are
      discontinuing the phone services requiring in-person identification while
      closing 10 regional offices. Martin O’Malley, the former commissioner of
      the SS admin, warns that
      <a
        href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/03/01/doge-actions-may-cause-social-security-benefit-interruption-ex-agency-head.html"
        >DOGE’s activities could interrupt the department's history of never
        missing a benefit payment.</a
      >. Senator Elizabeth Warren described a scenario where an elderly person
      with mobility issues could face a two-hour drive just to get to a Social
      Security office—possibly missing months of benefits if they can’t. As she
      says,<a
        href="https://www.newsweek.com/elizabeth-warren-doge-social-security-warning-2052170"
      >
        these are backdoor cuts</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      While the SSA is working on which
      <a
        href="https://blog.ssa.gov/social-security-announces-workforce-and-organization-plans/"
        >12% will be cut from its workforce</a
      >, other federal departments are already trapped in chaos—caught in a
      bureaucratic merry-go-round of disappearing jobs and unclear roles. VA
      mental health staff hired to work from home are now required to work in
      the office in cubicles and provide their virtual services. Mental health
      sessions are now delivered like call center scripts—boxed in by beige
      partitions, surrounded by strangers. Patients hear other people’s trauma
      while being watched through glass. The answer? Managers recommended a
      white noise machine. It’s not a solution—it’s a silencing device. The
      therapists’ or their patients’ comfort is no longer a priority, it's an
      obstacle.

        >These sudden changes in working conditions </a
      >are pushing workers out. And honestly, who can blame them. Judges have
      ordered the rehiring of many workers fired from their positions, only for
      those workers to be immediately put on
      <a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/trump-fired-federal-workers-rehired-ac9afd4165c3110d7d7ee6c81eba0101#:~:text=rehired%20but%20was%20immediately%20placed%20on%20administrative%20leave%20with%20backpay."
        >administrative leave instead of going back to work</a
      >. The result? Morale? Gone. Predictability? None. People opting out of
      federal work altogether.
    </p>
    <p>
      When you gut thousands of experienced federal workers with no plan and no
      warning, you don’t just create unemployment– you create opportunity. China
      and Russia don’t need spies when they can just search Linkedin for a list
      of names and a reason to listen.
    </p>
    <p>
      Experts warn that this mass exodus is flooding the job market with people
      who hold deep, sensitive knowledge of how our institutions work.
      <a

        >And the biggest national security threat isn’t the ones who held
        clearances</a
      >—it’s the ones you’d never expect. Foreign adversaries are increasingly
      targeting civilian infrastructure: workers from Social Security, the VA,
      even agriculture. That may not sound dangerous, until it is.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with Elon and Trump dismantling oversight, disrupting pay, and
      demoralizing the workforce, they’re practically handing adversaries a pool
      of angry, skilled, and underemployed Americans—some of whom just might
      take the call.

      Bad actors know how to seem legit. It will likely be a scheme similar to
      one last year where popular
      <a
        href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/well-known-right-wing-influencers-duped-to-work-for-covert-russian-operation-u-s-prosecutors-say"
        >conservative commentators were paid massive sums by Russia</a
      >. The blueprint is there: create a fake company with a facade of
      legitimacy, recruit recently unemployed federal workers to “consult” and
      pay them handsomely. They won’t even realize they are selling out their
      country.
    </p>
    <p>
      Meanwhile, DOGE is disabling the watchdogs. The Cyber Safety Review Board
      that was investigating how China has interfered with some of America’s
      largest telecommunications systems? Disbanded. The think tank inside the
      DOD that focused on foreseeing future defense vulnerabilities known as the
      <a
        href="https://www.strategycentral.io/post/the-end-of-the-office-of-net-assessment-a-shortsighted-blow-to-american-military-strategy"
        >Office of Net Assessment</a
      >? Gone. All under the administration that is dropping classified attack
      plans on a Signal group they unwittingly invited a reporter to and not
      super interested in investigating any of their mistakes.
    </p>
    <p>
      Our weakest links are the first to break, but in healthy systems we work
      to reinforce them. Trump's modus operandi has been to break everything and
      see what survives or is necessary enough to be revived. Some damage will
      be permanent no matter the remedy. Some simply won’t fight back – and
      that's the bet. While their goal may be to overthrow a system that checks
      their overreach, they are also breaking the institutions that protect us
      all. They won’t second guess themselves. They won’t mitigate the
      consequences.
    </p>
    <p>But rest assured—they’ll cover their tracks. And the rest of us?</p>
    <p>We’re left living inside a fail too big to save.</p>
