      On March 24th, Jeffrey Goldberg, editor in chief of the Atlantic,

      revealing that top officials from the Trump Administration added him to a
      group chat and subsequently . Here’s a TL;DR of the entire story, with
      plenty of links if you’d like to dig deeper.

    <h4><a id="_82h53b7h2ez0"></a>So what happened?</h4>

        >On March 11th, 2025</a
      >, Jeffrey Goldberg received a connection request on the messaging app
      Signal from Michael Waltz, National Security Advisor of the United States.
      Signal is an open-source, encrypted messaging service that is popular
      among journalists and those in political spaces. Two days later, on March
      13th, Goldberg was invited to a group chat labeled “Houthi PC small
      group”. This chat included J.D. Vance, Pete Hegseth, Marco Rubio, Stephen
      Miller, Steve Witkoff, Tulsi Gabbard, and more. The next day Goldberg
      would be privy to debate on the subject, with Vance disagreeing with
      Trump’s position on the timing of military activity in Yemen and stating
      “I just hate bailing out Europe again”. On March 15th,
      <a

        >Hegseth sent seemingly classified information</a
      >, detailing operational timing, aircraft and targeting intelligence for
      forthcoming strikes in Yemen.

        >These strikes were targeted at the Houthis </a
      >in retaliation for the group’s attacks on American ships in the Red Sea.
      Goldberg had access to these messages roughly 2 hours before the attacks
      were to commence, and once he had verified the attacks were real, Goldberg
      left the group chat. When the story dropped on March 24th, Gabbard and
      others were already scheduled for hearings in front of congress the
      following day. The timing of the drop allowed for little time to
      coordinate messaging, and the

      >. After Gabbard asserted that no information in the group was classified,

    <h4><a id="_l624odtlsaga"></a>So why is this a big deal?</h4>
    <p>
      The use of unsecured communication channels for discussing classified
      military operations may violate several federal statutes, including:​
    </p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <strong>Espionage Act:</strong> This act penalizes the unauthorized
        handling and transmission of national defense information. Officials'
        use of Signal for such discussions could be seen as gross negligence,
        <a
          href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2025/03/trump-administration-accidentally-texted-me-its-war-plans/682151/"
          >potentially leading to charges under this act.</a
        >
        Because of the highly sensitive nature of the information disclosed,
        whether or not the information
        <a
          href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/26/politics/classified-sensitive-information-signal-chat-what-matters/index.html"
          >was technically classified is irrelevant.
        </a>
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong
          >Federal Records Act (FRA) and Presidential Records Act (PRA):</strong
        >
        These laws require the preservation of government records.
        Communications conducted over Signal may not have been properly
        archived, as the messages were set to disappear after a
        <a
          href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/27/us/politics/signal-messages-disappear.html"
