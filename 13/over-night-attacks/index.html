  <p>Brutal Overnight Attacks on Ukraine and the Looming Russian Summer
    Offensive </p>
  <p>Thomas R Ullmann </p>
  <p>May 25, 2025 </p>
  <p>Last night witnessed one of the heaviest combined drone–missile barrages
    since February 2024. A salvo of fourteen Iskander–M ballistic missiles and
    roughly 250 Shahed drones swept across Ukraine, most of them aimed at Kyiv.
    Ukrainian air–defence crews intercepted fewer than half of the missiles, but
    neutralised more than two–thirds of the drones, with many others forced down
    by electronic warfare. [9, 10] </p>
  <p>Although the capital remained the primary target, alerts covered seven
    regions. One woman was killed near Kozacha Lopan in Kharkiv Oblast and
    fifteen civilians were injured in Kyiv as debris ignited apartment blocks.
    Power outages rippled through Odesa and Sumy after sub–stations were
    disabled by falling fragments. [9, 11] </p>
  <p>This spring has seen a steady rise in paired drone–missile raids intended
    to saturate Ukrainian air defences; with clear skies forecast, officials
    warn of repeat attacks and have renewed demands for additional Western
    interceptors. [19] </p>

  <p><strong>The 2025 May front-line </strong></p>
  <p>The US–brokered April moratorium on strikes against each other’s power
    infrastructure has effectively collapsed, and the land war has reverted to
    attritional routines. On the Donetsk axis, Russian assault detachments inch
    west from their Pokrovsk salient behind daily glide– bomb strikes, yet gains
    rarely exceed 300–500 metres per week. [12] Meanwhile, repeated
    river–crossing attempts at the Dnipro estuary continue to fail, despite
    battalion–sized operations mounted almost weekly. [13] </p>
  <p>Ukrainian forces are practising so–called “elastic defence”: they fall back
    from untenable positions, counter–attack with first–person–view drones, and
    rely on satellite–fed fire–control grids to attrite Russian armour. [14]
    Kyiv has also widened the contest by authorising cross– border raids and
    precision strikes on ammunition depots in Belgorod and Grayvoron, sowing
    confusion and forcing Moscow to disperse air–defence assets. [15] </p>
  <p>Satellite imagery released in late May shows Russian battalion tactical
    group (BTG) density around Pokrovsk hovering at roughly fifty percent of
    peak February levels, suggesting manpower rotation fatigue. [11] Conversely,
    Ukrainian engineers have completed the first belt of a concrete “dragon’s
    teeth” line west of the town, indicating that Kyiv expects to conduct a
    protracted, defence-in-depth campaign rather than immediate
    counter-offensives. [12] </p>
  <p><strong>Potential summer offensive </strong></p>
  <p>The Royal United Services Institute notes that Kremlin recruitment has
    consistently overshot monthly targets since last autumn, allowing Moscow to
    reconstitute three under–strength divisions east of the Pokrovsk sector.
    [16] Yet the same report forecasts a shortage of 152 mm artillery shells by
    the end of 2025 unless China or North Korea expand deliveries. [17] </p>
  <p>Ukrainian manpower remains stretched; the average age of front–line
    infantry has risen to forty-one, and brigade rotations have lengthened from
    five to eight weeks. [18] Nevertheless, Kyiv’s doctrine of “high-tech
    endurance”-melding FPV drones, precision artillery and Western real-time
    intelligence has blunted recent Russian thrusts. [19] </p>
  <p>Western and Ukrainian intelligence converge on a most–likely Russian
    operational design: a concentric push that seeks to envelop Pokrovsk while
    staging diversionary pressure in northern Kharkiv to fix reserves. [20, 12]
    Analysts caution, however, that Russia’s offensive potential will crest by
    late summer as trained infantry pools deplete and glide–bomb stockpiles
    erode faster than production. [21] </p>
  <p><strong>Echoes of World War I, how Ukraine can win </strong></p>
  <p>Currently around 8% of Russian GDP supports the war, while defence and
    security already consume over 40% of federal expenditure—the highest share
    since the Soviet collapse. [18, 21] Rail–freight volumes are 7% lower
    year–on–year, signalling a cooling war–driven boom, and analysts argue that
    a $30–per–barrel oil–price cap could shave 40% off Kremlin export revenue.
    [18] </p>
  <p>Parallels with Imperial Germany are unavoidable: despite occupying swathes
    of Belgium and France in 1916–18, Berlin succumbed with average war outlays
    at 42% of GDP and the home front imploded with civil unrest. For Russia to
    meet a similar fate without territorial collapse, sanctions will have to
    bite deeper than at present. </p>
  <p>History never repeats itself perfectly. China added a wild-card absent in
    1918; Beijing can backfill hardware and finance, yet remains cautious of
    secondary sanctions. </p>
  <p>Hence the support of Ukraine must be three pronged. Firstly, China must be
    both shown the stick ,and offered the carrot, a blend of incentives and
    penalties. Trade with China must be maintained in order to have leverage in
    order to prevent further military chinese aid reaching Russia. Secondly,
    Ukraine must get continued support in order to hold the front-line, both
    lethal and non-lethal aid, including secured access to intelligence in order
    to operate its long range capabilities. Delays can no longer be a feature of
    this war. Thirdly, sanctions must act deeper and more broadly than seen thus
    far. Russian oil refined in India and shipped to Europe must cease. </p>
  <p>Ukraine is western democracy’s eastern flank and thus <strong>must
    </strong>be supported if our democracies are to be secured. The sacrifices
    of Ukrainian service men and women need not be in vain. </p>
