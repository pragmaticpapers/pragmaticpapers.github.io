  <p>On Sunday, May 18th, once again, we were reminded exactly who is and isn’t
    seeking peace. Ukraine endured its <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/18/nx-s1-5402815/zelenskyy-meets-vance-in-rome-hours-after-russias-largest-drone-attack-on-ukraine">largest
      drone assault</a> since the full-scale invasion began, 273 drones in
    total, just as President Zelenskyy met with U.S. Vice President JD Vance,
    Secretary of State Marco Rubio, and Pope Leo XIV in Rome. The strikes hit
    Kyiv, Dnipropetrovsk, and Donetsk, killing one civilian and injuring several
    others, including, of course, children. And yet, Ukraine is still being told
    to wait, to be patient, for the peace talks to truly “begin,” while European
    leaders keep pressing for a ceasefire that Russia seems determined to ignore
    outright.</p>
  <p>Monday, we finally saw the results of <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/china/trump-speak-putin-end-war-ukraine-europeans-demand-ceasefire-2025-05-19/">Trump</a>’s
    much-hyped direct call with Putin—and, well, it went about as you’d expect.
    Trump announced that Ukraine and Russia would “immediately” begin ceasefire
    negotiations. Again, though, don't forget Ukraine has spent the last two
    weeks actively pushing for a ceasefire, even sending Zelenskyy to Istanbul
    just days ago in hopes of meeting Putin face-to-face. Meanwhile, European
    leaders, reportedly “shocked” by Trump’s refusal to impose new sanctions,
    are moving ahead with pressure measures of their own, but we have heard this
    before. Trump, for his part, waved off the idea, saying “there’s a chance of
    getting something done” and warning that pressing too hard “could make it
    worse.” Putin is clearly playing for time. And frankly, he plays Trump way
    too easily. How many times do we have to watch this same routine before even
    Trump gets tired of being strung along? To borrow a classic line from George
    W. Bush: “Fool me once, shame on — shame on you. Fool me — you can’t get
    fooled again.” Man, how I miss him.</p>

  <p>On Tuesday, as expected, Trump’s ceasefire push began to unravel the moment
    cameras turned off. In Ukraine, there was little surprise. Most saw the
    Monday call for what it was: another round of empty promises with no
    timeline, no pressure on Putin, and no meaningful concessions. In cities
    like Sumy and Kharkiv, under constant bombardment, Ukrainians are
    increasingly tuning out the “talks” entirely, and man, I cannot blame them.
    As one woman put it, <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/world/europe/ukraine-trump-reaction.html">Trump’s
      diplomacy</a> was “a theatrical performance that has nothing to do with
    the reality of trenches or bomb shelters.” Meanwhile, Secretary of State
    Marco Rubio told Congress the U.S. is helping secure air defenses for
    Ukraine, though nobody seems willing to give up their Patriot systems. On
    the battlefield, Russian forces are ramping up their offensives under the
    cover of “negotiations,” with soldiers warning that this summer could bring
    a major new push. Zelenskyy, still hoping to keep U.S. ties from fraying
    further, reportedly sent Trump a proposal for a free-trade deal. But on the
    front lines, the consensus is simple: if peace is coming, it won’t be thanks
    to Trump; it will be purely due to the Ukrainian spirit.</p>
  <p>By Wednesday, Trump’s new position on Ukraine could not be clearer: <em>not
      my problem.</em> After months of insisting he alone could end the war,
    he’s now washing his hands of it entirely, telling Zelenskyy and European
    leaders they’ll have to figure it out themselves, just days after promising
    new sanctions if Russia didn’t cooperate. Not only did he back away from
    that threat, he also pivoted to <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/20/us/politics/trump-ukraine-russia.html">floating
      future business deals</a> with Russia, saying the country has “unlimited
    potential.” As U.S. pressure evaporates immediately due to one phone call,
    Europe is scrambling to hold the line, but the cracks inside NATO are
    exactly what Putin has been banking on. And if that wasn't enough, Spain on
    this same day would see Andriy Portnov, a former Ukrainian politician with
    extremely deep pro-Russian ties, <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukrainian-ex-politician-shot-dead-outside-madrids-american-school-source-says-2025-05-21/">assassinated</a>
    in broad daylight, multiple rounds to the back and head, broad daylight, no
    arrests. </p>

  <p>Thursday, May 22nd: While Trump continues backing away from Ukraine, the
    U.S. quietly took a meaningful step forward, with <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/legalindustry/breaking-ground-us-ukraine-mineral-deal-ratified-ukraine-paving-way-2025-05-22/">Congress
      and Kyiv ratifying a landmark mineral deal</a> that could help jumpstart
    postwar reconstruction. The agreement gives the U.S. preferential access to
    Ukraine’s vast mineral reserves, including rare earths, and ties future aid
    to joint development projects. It’s a play to align long-term economic
    interests and to prevent countries like China or Russia from dominating
    Ukraine’s reconstruction. Ukrainian officials are calling it a cornerstone
    for recovery, though plenty of questions remain, from how the fund will be
    governed to whether idle mining licenses near the front can ever be brought
    online. But with Russia escalating attacks and Trump openly talking about
    doing business with Moscow, a grim question hangs in the air: What will be
    left of Ukraine should Trump continue to give Russia unlimited room to
    invade? </p>
  <p>Friday, May 23rd, in the<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-prisoner-swap.html">
      largest prisoner exchange</a> of the war so far, 390 Ukrainians came home,
    many after years of torture, starvation, and near-total isolation. Families
    gathered in the Chernihiv region, waving flags and holding worn photos,
    hoping their loved ones would be on the buses. For some, the wait ended in
    tears of joy. For others, it was yet another blow of many for this war. One
    woman sobbed when her husband failed to appear; another soldier, finally
    able to speak to loved ones, reached his mother, “Mom, I was exchanged. I’m
    alive.” The deal, agreed to during the recent Istanbul summit, is one of the
    few moments of cooperation since the war began. And yet, even this good
    news, Ukrainians aren’t allowed to rest, within hours, Kyiv was under
    another wave of Russian strikes. It’s hard not to see the pattern: for every
    step forward, Moscow takes three steps back. <br /><br />Saturday, May 24th,
    <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250524183157/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/05/24/trump-putin-battlefield-ceasefire-ukraine/">Russia’s
      battlefield momentum is slowing</a>, its forces being ground down at
    roughly 1,500 casualties a day, with analysts warning Moscow could face
    critical shortages of tanks, missiles, and manpower by next year. Is that
    why Trump seems so eager to give Putin an off-ramp? Does he realize Russia
    can’t sustain this and wants to hand them a way out before total
    embarrassment sets in? After his recent call with Putin, the promised
    pressure vanished—no new sanctions, no fresh aid, just more talk of trade
    deals. U.S. intelligence believes this summer may be Russia’s last real
    window to break through before its war machine buckles under years of losses
    and sanctions. And yet, instead of tightening the grip on Moscow, Trump
    seems apathetic, leaving it to “the Europeans or the new pope,” and letting
    Putin control the pace, but for what?</p>
