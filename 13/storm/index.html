  <p> Hurricane season is coming y'all. Last year it consisted of 18 named
    storms and 11 hurricanes. Specifically, Hurricane Helene which
    devastated…Appalachia?? You don’t really think that hurricanes would come up
    through the Gulf of Mexico demolishing the mountain region that lines the
    borders of Georgia, Tennessee, and the Carolinas, but it did. Helene was so
    damaging that the World Meteorological Organization <a

      most accurate on record</a>, marking a 75% improvement since the 90’s.
    (The NOAA, National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, <a
      href="https://www.noaa.gov/news-release/noaa-predicts-above-normal-2024-atlantic-hurricane-season">predicted
      17-25 named storms and 8-13 hurricanes</a>.) The NOAA also predicts 2025
    to be an “above-normal” hurricane season.<a

      Commerce Secretary Howard Lutnick</a> — best known as a finance executive
    with no background in meteorology — says that with the NOAA models, we are
    well prepared for hurricane season. So much so that the <a
      href="https://www.wired.com/story/fema-cancel-strategic-plan/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Trump
      Admin canceled</a> the 2022-2026 Strategic Hurricane Season Plan. No
    replacement plan has been provided, leaving a gap in coordinated disaster
    readiness. Measurements of performance included things like training to
    state partners on how to handle disasters, disaster mitigation that
    considers impacts of climate change (a bad word) and the worst of all, a
    goal of equitable disbursement of disaster relief, which was defined as the
    goal of providing assistance in a “<a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250203020509/https://www.fema.gov/about/strategic-plan">systemic,
      fair, just, and impartial treatment of all individuals</a>,” which is
    basically DEI to the Trump Admin.</p>
  <p><strong>How FEMA Becomes the Villain</strong></p>
  <p> FEMA staff has been <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/politics/fema-staff-cuts-hurricane-season#:~:text=With%20hurricane%20season%20just%20weeks%20away%2C%20about%2020%25%20of%20FEMA%E2%80%99s%20permanent%20full%2Dtime%20staff%20%E2%80%93%20roughly%201%2C000%20workers">cut
      by about 20%</a> thanks to DOGE. This includes experienced, <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/fema-senior-officials-exit-en-masse-trump-targets-agency-2025-05-22/">senior
      staff that have been pushed out</a>. The folks at FEMA have been put
    through it for sure. Last year, when trying to deal with Helene,
    conspiracies from right wing media consistently undercut their efforts to
    provide aid. They were accused of not providing enough aid when the initial
    $750 emergency aid was provided, even though this was just for quick relief
    and never intended to be all relief provided. Claims from prominent
    Republicans, like Marjorie Taylor Green stating the government directed the
    storm to Trump friendly territory using “special weather control” methods
    caused people that <a
      href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/fema-chief-calls-false-claims-about-governments-helene-response-truly-dangerous">needed
      aid to become distrustful of FEMA</a>, believing they were there to <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/10/06/us/hurricane-helene-north-carolina-misinformation.html">take
      their land for lithium mining, they were hoarding resources</a>, or using
    it to give money to illegal immigrants. FEMA workers had to work with
    threats of roaming militias too.</p>
  <p> Morale at the agency was already low before Trump came into office. Now
    they are dealing with an executive who sees FEMA as unnecessary. He believes
    states should bear more of the cos<strong>t</strong> for disaster management
    with no plan to adjust in place and the most disaster-prone season on the
    horizon. The<a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/R47646"> Stafford
      Act passed by</a> Congress set a default cost-sharing arrangement for
    disaster relief, with 75% provided by the Federal Government and 25% by the
    State Government. However, this ratio can be adjusted at the President’s
    discretion. Trump wants to make this a<a
      href="https://www.wired.com/story/fema-cancel-strategic-plan/"> 50/50
      split</a>. The contrast couldn’t be sharper: Biden used this same
    discretionary authority to increase federal aid — even covering 100% of
    costs for a time after Helene. Trump, on the other hand, is using it to
    reduce the federal share. So technically, he doesn’t need to change the law
    — just the precedent. And we’ve seen what he does with precedent. And we’ve
    seen what he does with precedent. </p>
  <p><strong>The Death of BRIC</strong></p>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/image1.png" alt="Image 1" />
    <span class="caption"></span>
  </div>
  <p> Trump and the folks at DOGE also <a
      href="https://infrastructurereportcard.org/fema-ends-bric-program/">canceled
      all pending BRICs contracts</a>. The Building Resilient Infrastructure and
    Communities (BRIC) program, funded through Biden’s 2021 infrastructure bill,
    aimed to support disaster mitigation projects. These contracts focused on
    disaster mitigation like making sure infrastructure was built in a way to
    withstand or avoid things like hurricanes or floods. I remember being
    concerned that many of the results from Biden’s infrastructure bill wouldn’t
    show up until Trump was in office — giving him a chance to take credit for
    the improvements. What I didn’t expect was for him to cancel the projects
    outright and pull back the funding. And yet, in true Trump fashion, he’s
    still taking credit for infrastructure wins made possible by the very bill
    he gutted. In one <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/democrats/comments/1ku9m31/this_was_recently_posted_to_my_state_subreddit_ct/">viral
      post circulating on Reddit</a>, users pointed out that Trump touted a
    newly funded project in Connecticut — one that was clearly funded under
    Biden’s infrastructure law. It's one thing to cancel the parade, but it's
    another to show up on the float.</p>
  <p><strong>What They are Funding</strong></p>
  <p> This is not to say the Trump admin will help no one. Funding has been
    approved in several states to address wildfires through assistance known as
    Fire Management Assistance. This sort of aid, known as Fire Management
    Assistance Grants (FMAGs), is focused on addressing disasters that are
    actively occurring — providing immediate response support rather than
    long-term rebuilding or prevention. Necessary for sure, but it’s more
    expensive to rebuild. Decoupling this with disaster mitigation will be more
    expensive and damaging in the long run.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>So heading into the hurricane season, we have fewer staff at FEMA, less
    training to states for disaster preparation and response, and mass canceling
    of projects to improve infrastructure. That’s not all though, the Trump
    admin is actively denying disaster aid to states as well. Washington was <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/fema-disaster-aid-washington-bomb-cyclone-appeal-2dfcdc1ced2afd9197c25f1047112b00">denied
      FEMA aid in April</a> for damage from a November storm. They are shifting
    the cost share from Helene to require <a
      href="https://ncnewsline.com/2025/04/12/fema-will-stop-matching-100-of-helene-recovery-money-in-nc-stein-says/">North
      Carolina to provide more state funding</a>, and <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/fema-delay-tornado-disaster-mississippi-tylertown-00c644598b4f4693c116b9eb5eae3bae">Mississippi
      had to wait 3 months</a> before they were approved for funding to fix
    damages incurred during tornadoes in March.</p>

  </div>

    Network Florida</p>
  <p> There are also cracks in the system starting to show. The National Weather
    Service has had to rely on <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/doge-weather-cuts-tornado-dangerous-staff-warnings-aa7db3e0d0009d99c143742ab722c40a">shifting
      staff from neighboring offices</a> to get the appropriate tornado warnings
    out after DOGE cut 20% of the staff. They have also had to cut <a
      href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/doge-cuts-nws-balloon-sites-leave-us-without-crucial-weather-data-some-meteorologists-say/">weather
      balloon sites</a>, which is a vital source of real time weather data. This
    information will be vital during hurricane season since they greatly improve
    short-term store predication and “ground truth” measurements that aren’t
    provided by satellites. </p>
  <p><strong>"Priority" Shift</strong></p>
  <p> Of course, if the corruption isn’t blatant, it wouldn’t be the Trump
    admin. After scouring the recent funding changes, House Dems noticed that in
    many cases, <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/21/politics/blue-state-flood-prevention-cuts">funding
      was pulled from blue states while red states saw an increase</a>. Overall,
    Democratic Senators lost about $436 million that would have been received
    under Biden’s original plan, while Republican Senators gained about $257
    million. In response, GOP Rep. Tony Gonzales simply says, “There is your
    incentive to be a Republican state… Washington has picked winners and losers
    for a long time. It's not going to stop picking winners and losers. Better
    to be on the winning side, than on the losing side.”</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p> Fortunately, I’ve never needed FEMA aid. But most people who do aren't
    irresponsible — they’re overwhelmed. In Appalachia, people lost their homes
    to catastrophic flooding. And honestly, who expects to need flood insurance
    on a mountain? And even if you can rebuild your house, what good is that
    when your neighbors’ homes are gone, the road is washed out, and the water's
    still rising?</p>
  <p>No one who voted for Trump thought they were voting to defund FEMA. They
    weren’t signing up for a system that delays aid, cancels prevention, and
    punishes the states that ask for help.But that's what they got. Helene hit
    hard, and the White House hit harder.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In 2024, Biden sent help. In 2026, Trump will ask for votes. I hope people
    remember who showed up when the storm passed.</p>
