  <p>Gideon’s Chariots: The Ground War in Gaza and the Mechanics of Modern Urban
    Occupation</p>
  <p>In 332 BCE, Alexander the Great laid siege to Gaza, then a fortified city
    perched on the edge of empire and defiance. It took the Macedonian king two
    months to conquer the city, during which time he deployed siege engines, dug
    trenches, and unleashed relentless assaults against a deeply entrenched and
    ideologically committed resistance. The campaign was not merely a test of
    military power, but of imperial will, proof that the projection of dominance
    could not succeed without the capacity to sustain it under the pressure of
    attrition, ambush, and terrain. Alexander’s ultimate victory came at a cost
    and marked the beginning of a prolonged and uneasy integration of the city
    into Hellenistic control. Nearly 2,400 years later, the Israeli Defense
    Forces (IDF) now find themselves waging a<a
      href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/idf-announces-start-operation-gideons-chariots-gaza-ground/story?id=121930267">
      similarly fraught battle for Gaza</a>, under an operation ominously dubbed
    Gideon’s Chariots.</p>
  <p>Where Alexander relied on stone rams and wooden towers, the IDF now employs
    digitized command networks, mechanized forces, armor, and aerial drones. Yet
    the structural challenges remain strikingly familiar: a densely populated
    urban battlespace, a committed adversary, and a city whose political
    significance far exceeds its geographic size. Gideon’s Chariots is not just
    a military campaign, it is an assertion of sovereign power over a
    recalcitrant terrain, and a test of whether advanced battlefield
    technologies can overcome the historical constraints of holding hostile
    ground. In this respect, the operation is as much an epistemological
    proposition as it is a kinetic one: can a state unmake insurgency through
    total spatial and infrastructural domination?</p>
  <p>The IDF’s objectives are multifaceted and strategically ambitious: to
    disarm Hamas, prevent its reconstitution, and partition Gaza into
    controllable sectors under sustained Israeli oversight. According to
    statements from defense officials, the campaign will proceed in a series of
    phases beginning with kinetic clearing operations, followed by a geographic
    segmentation of the Strip into militarily manageable zones. This phased
    approach implies not only territorial conquest, but a vision of long-term
    counterinsurgency and spatial governance, tactics that extend well beyond
    conventional military doctrine and toward the logic of protracted
    occupation. The question is not whether Israel can take Gaza, but whether it
    can hold it, and at what cost, politically and morally.</p>
  <p><a
      href="https://www.newsweek.com/why-israels-new-gaza-operation-different-2075452">Operation
      Gideon’s Chariots</a> marks a significant doctrinal departure from
    previous Israeli military actions in Gaza, characterized not merely by the
    scale of kinetic force applied but by its phased, territorial logic. The IDF
    have articulated a multi-phase strategy that begins with intensive ground
    incursions designed to “clear” specific urban zones of Hamas operatives and
    infrastructure, before transitioning into a prolonged “hold” phase involving
    permanent or semi-permanent deployments across the strip. This evolution in
    operational planning reflects a recalibration of Israeli military thought,
    one that seeks to transition from short-term punitive raids toward sustained
    territorial dominance, premised on the conviction that a durable security
    solution cannot coexist with Hamas' survival or sovereignty in Gaza.</p>

  <p>The tactical<a
      href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/will-israels-new-chariots-plan-trample-or-strengthen-hamas">
      centerpiece</a> of the plan involves the segmentation of Gaza into
    isolated military sectors. Each sector will be subjected to concentrated
    ground pressure and methodical clearing operations before being physically
    and electronically cordoned off to prevent the reentry of hostile forces.
    IDF units will proceed in a north-to-south progression, dividing the strip
    along major urban corridors and seizing critical infrastructure nodes, such
    as tunnel networks, command centers, and munitions depots. This operational
    geometry intends to fracture Hamas’ territorial continuity, disaggregate its
    command structure, and eliminate its capacity for coordinated resistance.
    The implementation of this “salami-slice” model of urban conquest reflects
    lessons drawn from earlier asymmetric engagements, including those in Jenin,
    Fallujah, and Mosul.</p>
  <p>Strategically, the operation is designed not only to degrade Hamas
    militarily but to<a
      href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/19/what-is-israels-new-major-ground-offensive-operation-gideons-chariots">
      nullify its political influence</a> within Gaza by rendering it
    territorially and symbolically irrelevant. The IDF’s stated goal is to
    dismantle Hamas’ ability to govern, not merely its capacity to launch
    rockets or execute raids. Accordingly, the military objectives encompass<a
      href="https://www.israelhayom.com/2025/05/22/idf-plan-unveiled-dividing-gaza-strip-seizing-territory-months-long-clearing-phase/">
      control of key administrative centers</a>, communications hubs, and
    critical civilian access points such as border crossings and hospitals,
    which function as logistical arteries during wartime. By embedding control
    mechanisms at both tactical and bureaucratic levels, the IDF aims to
    establish an architecture of dominance that prevents any post-conflict
    resurgence of Islamist governance in the enclave.</p>
  <p>This paradigm of occupation via fragmentation draws implicitly from
    counterinsurgency doctrines that emphasize spatial control as a prerequisite
    for political transformation. However, the IDF’s embrace of a prolonged
    presence, perhaps indefinite in some sectors, raises questions about
    Israel’s long-term capacity to sustain such operations amid fluctuating
    political support, asymmetric resistance, and international scrutiny. The
    operational clarity of Gideon’s Chariots<a
      href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/poll-most-israelis-think-pm-cares-more-about-holding-power-than-winning-war-freeing-hostages/">
      is not matched</a> by a coherent political roadmap for post-conflict
    governance or legitimacy-building. Thus, while the campaign may succeed in
    achieving battlefield superiority, it remains to be seen whether it can
    deliver a lasting strategic end state or whether it will instead reproduce
    the very conditions of instability it seeks to extinguish.</p>
  <p><a
      href="https://www.stimson.org/2023/unpacking-the-history-of-urban-warfare-and-its-challenges-in-gaza/">Urban
      warfare represents</a> one of the most complex operational environments in
    contemporary military strategy, and Gaza epitomizes its most intractable
    form. Characterized by dense civilian infrastructure, multilayered building
    elevations, and subterranean tunnel networks, Gaza’s urban fabric blurs the
    line between combatant and noncombatant space. The IDF, through Operation
    Gideon’s Chariots, is deploying an integrated approach involving heavy
    armor, advanced surveillance, and combat engineering to navigate and
    dominate this battlespace. The unique spatial constraints demand
    decentralized decision-making at the squad and platoon level, while
    simultaneously requiring real-time coordination with aerial intelligence and
    logistical support, necessitating a level of operational synchronization
    that borders on the doctrinally experimental.</p>
  <p>At the center of Israel’s tactical doctrine is the coordinated use of tanks
    and armored personnel carriers, designed not just for survivability in
    high-threat environments but for supporting dismounted infantry in
    hyper-local engagements. These platforms, equipped with active protection
    systems such as Trophy, are meant to mitigate the risks posed by anti-tank
    guided missiles and improvised explosive devices, both of which are
    signature elements of Hamas’ defensive repertoire. Simultaneously, Israel’s
    specialized<a
      href="https://www.idf.il/en/mini-sites/our-corps-units-brigades/yahalom-unit/yahalom-unit/">
      Yahalom combat engineering</a> units are tasked with detecting,
    neutralizing, and mapping tunnel networks that may span kilometers beneath
    densely populated neighborhoods. This subterranean dimension introduces a
    vertical complexity to combat operations, turning each block into a
    three-dimensional battlespace with hidden threats both above and below.</p>
  <p>The IDF’s tactical<a
      href="https://mwi.westpoint.edu/learning-to-learn-lessons-for-the-us-army-from-the-israel-defense-forces-wartime-adaption/">
      adaptation</a> is further enhanced by its integration of real-time drone
    surveillance, SIGINT collection, and AI-assisted target recognition,
    allowing units to engage with heightened precision. These technologies
    reduce the fog of war but do not eliminate the ethical dilemmas inherent in
    operating among civilians. Hamas’ strategic embedding within hospitals,
    schools, and residential towers transforms tactical maneuvers into legal and
    moral quandaries. The IDF’s stated approach, precision engagement,
    pre-strike warnings, and proportional force, is as much a legal posture as
    it is a tactical imperative, one designed to forestall international
    condemnation while attempting to degrade Hamas’ command-and-control
    architecture.</p>
  <p>Despite its technological superiority, the IDF faces the same historical
    challenge that has plagued<a
      href="https://warontherocks.com/2019/05/urban-legend-is-combat-in-cities-really-inevitable/">
      urban counterinsurgency for decades</a>: the risk of overextension and
    tactical success without strategic consolidation. Every street secured may
    contain latent insurgent infrastructure, every civilian spared may become a
    future combatant under conditions of prolonged occupation. In this regard,
    Operation Gideon’s Chariots is not merely a test of Israel’s technological
    prowess but a crucible of doctrinal innovation. Whether the operation
    culminates in decisive territorial control or devolves into protracted
    attrition will depend less on the IDF’s capacity to destroy infrastructure
    and more on its ability to sustain operational tempo while managing civilian
    dynamics in one of the most volatile urban theaters of the modern era.</p>
  <p>Israel’s current operational doctrine in Gaza reflects a shift from
    punitive expeditionary tactics toward a more classical “clear and hold”
    counterinsurgency model. Unlike previous campaigns characterized by
    short-term incursion and rapid withdrawal, this approach is predicated on a
    sequential and sustained projection of territorial dominance. The
    operational core involves a phased methodology: first, combat brigades
    conduct aggressive clearing operations to dismantle militant infrastructure;
    then, stabilization units establish a persistent presence in these zones to
    forestall re-infiltration. By dividing Gaza into sectors, some reports
    describe a grid-like framework, the IDF intends to impose localized control
    mechanisms that will allow for tighter management of both insurgent activity
    and civilian populations.</p>
  <p>The "hold" phase, however, presents complex logistical and doctrinal
    challenges that extend well beyond battlefield victory. Unlike kinetic
    engagements, which are often time-bound and objective-specific, the
    occupation of cleared urban terrain requires uninterrupted resupply chains,
    redundant communication nodes, static security outposts, and adaptable
    civil-military coordination frameworks. The IDF will be required to manage
    rotating personnel deployments, medical and engineering detachments, and a
    consistent psychological operations campaign aimed at maintaining civilian
    compliance or passivity. Such operations are inherently resource-intensive
    and require a level of endurance and adaptability that strains even advanced
    militaries operating on familiar terrain, let alone within one of the most
    densely populated and politically volatile urban environments on Earth.</p>
  <p>Integral to this strategy is the prevention of insurgent resurgence, which
    necessitates the transformation of tactical clearing into strategic denial.
    The IDF is reportedly deploying layered monitoring systems, incorporating
    drone swarms, subterranean detection networks, and AI-assisted threat
    modeling, to create an interlocking surveillance architecture. This system
    is designed to act as a tripwire, detecting and responding to attempts by
    Hamas or aligned factions to reestablish operational footholds. Yet, such
    mechanisms, no matter how technologically sophisticated, must contend with a
    physical and human environment that offers militants unparalleled
    concealment, psychological leverage, and strategic ambiguity. The ultimate
    question remains: can any state, even one with Israel’s capabilities,
    enforce a comprehensive and enduring military occupation in a space where
    the very act of holding ground is interpreted as an existential provocation?
  </p>
  <p>Moreover, the IDF’s planners appear cognizant of the risk that protracted
    occupation may paradoxically produce the very instability it seeks to quell.
    Holding territory in Gaza, particularly after the destruction of governance
    infrastructure and displacement of populations, necessitates not just
    physical presence but administrative control. This includes not only
    managing aid distribution, restoring basic utilities, and mediating local
    disputes, but also constructing a post-Hamas political framework without
    inviting further radicalization. The lack of clarity about a governing
    alternative, coupled with Israel’s insistence on not allowing Hamas or the
    Palestinian Authority to fill the vacuum, places additional burden on the
    military to serve as both enforcer and ad hoc administrator. In this sense,
    the “hold” phase may be less a conclusion than a transformation: from
    military operation to military governance, with all the perils that such a
    transformation historically entails.</p>
  <p>Despite Israel’s overwhelming firepower and technological superiority it
    faces a strategic paradox that has historically undermined even the most
    meticulously executed military campaigns: the insurgent’s advantage in
    asymmetry. As the IDF pushes deeper into urbanized zones of Gaza, their
    forces enter an environment designed to nullify conventional superiority.
    Hamas has had nearly two decades to prepare subterranean tunnel networks,
    preposition IEDs, and adapt to the rhythms of Israeli operational doctrine.
    Rather than meeting the IDF in force-on-force engagements, Hamas fighters
    are expected to disperse into civilian infrastructure, leveraging human
    shields and spatial familiarity to frustrate Israeli advances and increase
    the political cost of every IDF maneuver.</p>

      elasticity</a>” by Hamas, a doctrine of retreat, ambush, and
    re-infiltration, presents a particularly potent challenge to the IDF’s
    “clear and hold” paradigm. Urban density not only impedes maneuverability
    but also serves to compartmentalize conflict, allowing Hamas units to remain
    dormant in one neighborhood while engaging offensively in another. This
    decentralized approach undermines Israel’s traditional reliance on
    technological dominance, including drone-based ISR (Intelligence,
    Surveillance, and Reconnaissance) and electronic warfare systems, which
    become less effective in saturated electromagnetic environments and dense
    subterranean terrain. The adversary, in this context, becomes less a
    targetable military unit and more a fluid social ecosystem, capable of
    regeneration even in the face of localized tactical defeat.</p>
  <p>Moreover, Israel’s strategy risks creating a “second-phase” insurgency, in
    which Hamas, or successor factions, reemerge in the vacuum between
    territorial control and political resolution. Past conflicts in Iraq and
    Afghanistan have demonstrated that insurgent forces thrive in precisely this
    liminal space, where occupation is sustained but governance remains
    ambiguous. Absent a credible and accepted political authority to replace
    Hamas in post-clearing phases, IDF units may find themselves engaged in a
    protracted, manpower-intensive counterinsurgency, marked by attritional
    clashes, reputational degradation, and declining domestic support. The
    longer Gaza remains militarily subdued but politically unsettled, the more
    probable it becomes that resistance will mutate, rather than disappear.</p>
  <p>To mitigate this outcome, Israeli planners are reportedly developing
    predictive models of insurgent reconstitution, integrating intelligence from
    previous incursions with real-time data to identify likely points of
    resistance resurgence. These efforts, however, are constrained by the
    fluidity of human terrain, the opacity of local allegiances, and the
    inherently political nature of insurgent legitimacy. Technical
    countermeasures, such as tunnel demolition units, SIGINT integration, and
    rapid-response mechanized units, may address the kinetic dimensions of
    Hamas’s resistance doctrine, but they offer limited efficacy against the
    broader insurgent paradigm, which is embedded in grievance, identity, and
    narrative. In this light, the IDF’s operational success will depend not
    merely on its ability to hold ground, but on its capacity to anticipate,
    disrupt, and delegitimize the evolving modalities of Palestinian resistance.
  </p>
  <p>The question of whether Operation Gideon’s Chariots represents a tactical
    holding maneuver or a strategic blueprint for indefinite reoccupation
    remains deeply contested, not only within Israel's security establishment
    but also across its civilian political sphere. While the IDF has framed its
    objectives in operationally discrete terms, dismantling Hamas
    infrastructure, securing key urban corridors, and establishing buffer
    zones—there is a conspicuous absence of a clearly articulated political
    endgame. The ambiguity surrounding the duration and scope of Israel’s
    presence in post-clearing zones introduces strategic uncertainty that could
    destabilize both military efficacy and international legitimacy. In this
    sense, the operation risks devolving into a case study of what Eliot Cohen
    once termed “tactical brilliance in search of strategic clarity.”</p>
  <p>Public opinion within Israel reflects this ambivalence with striking
    consistency. According to recent polling from The Times of Israel, a
    majority of respondents believe that Prime Minister Netanyahu is more
    preoccupied with preserving his grip on power than with achieving a coherent
    wartime objective, such as the return of hostages or the durable
    neutralization of Hamas. This perception, whether accurate or not, exerts a
    corrosive effect on civil-military cohesion and complicates the legitimacy
    of extended operations. In environments where civilian trust in political
    leadership erodes, even high-functioning militaries may struggle to
    translate battlefield dominance into lasting strategic gains. The Israeli
    leadership’s inability, or unwillingness, to define a stable governing
    architecture for Gaza exacerbates the operational vacuum left in the wake of
    cleared zones.</p>
  <p>At the policy level, this uncertainty reverberates in the international
    arena, where Israel's allies and adversaries alike are attempting to
    decipher whether Gideon’s Chariots constitutes a transient operation or the
    prelude to de facto annexation. The absence of a civilian administration to
    replace Hamas, combined with Israel’s unwillingness to accept responsibility
    for governance, creates a paradox: territorial control without sovereign
    accountability. This condition, if prolonged, may resemble the
    “quasi-occupation” model observed in past U.S. interventions, where military
    forces exercised functional authority in the absence of legal recognition or
    sustainable governance frameworks. As such, the operation risks becoming
    trapped in an ethical and operational limbo, neither a clean exit nor a
    permanent state-building project. </p>
  <p>Strategically, the challenge lies not merely in seizing and holding
    territory, but in articulating a coherent vision of what that control is
    intended to accomplish. Without a viable political roadmap, be it
    administered by a multilateral force, a Palestinian alternative to Hamas, or
    even a transitional Israeli mechanism, the IDF’s control of Gaza could
    harden into a liability. A military that is perpetually clearing ground
    without a counterpart institution to hold it risks transforming tactical
    victories into strategic stagnation. As history repeatedly demonstrates, the
    failure to link operational tempo with political planning tends to yield
    diminishing returns and escalating resistance. In the case of Gideon’s
    Chariots, the absence of post-conflict architecture could turn Gaza from a
    conquered space into an enduring quagmire.</p>
  <p>The strategic ambition embodied in Operation Gideon’s Chariots evokes an
    ancient military dilemma: the ease of conquest versus the burden of
    governance. As with Alexander the Great’s siege of Gaza, the IDFs may well
    achieve operational success in dismantling Hamas' infrastructure and
    asserting control over key geographic corridors. Yet the specter of
    long-term occupation raises a fundamental question that has historically
    haunted every imperial power, from the Macedonians to the Americans in
    Fallujah: can an external force impose order, legitimacy, and enduring
    security in a territory where political authority and civil consent have
    been catastrophically fragmented?</p>
  <p>Tactically, the IDF has demonstrated extraordinary proficiency in adapting
    to the complexities of urban warfare, integrating mechanized units with
    precision intelligence and AI-assisted surveillance. However, these
    capabilities, while effective in clearing operations, do not resolve the
    socio-political vacuum that inevitably follows the kinetic phase of war. The
    very act of holding Gaza implies not only a military footprint but an
    administrative architecture capable of sustaining governance, delivering
    basic services, and mediating civil unrest. Absent a credible plan for
    post-conflict reconstruction or local political buy-in, Israeli forces risk
    becoming occupiers in a city perpetually at war with itself and its rulers,
    thereby transforming temporary tactical success into a strategic quagmire.
  </p>
  <p>Indeed, the current reoccupation plan, though cloaked in the language of
    security and necessity, risks creating a fortress without legitimacy, a
    military zone masquerading as a stable entity. Holding ground in Gaza is not
    merely a cartographic exercise; it demands the construction of political
    meaning amid ruins. Without a clearly articulated and regionally coordinated
    end-state, the IDF’s presence may provoke perpetual resistance,
    institutional fatigue, and international condemnation. In this light,
    Gideon’s Chariots may one day be remembered not as a chariot of liberation,
    but as a war machine entombed in the sand, a grim monument to the enduring
    paradox of war without peace.</p>
