  <p>On May 22nd, the House narrowly passed the <a
      href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/119th-congress/house-bill/1/text">“Big,
      Beautiful Bill,”</a> a piece of legislation that was endorsed by President
    Trump and Speaker Johnson, by one vote. The two Republicans who voted
    against it were Thomas Massie and Warren Davidson. Some Republicans even
    missed the vote, with <a
      href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/22/congress/garbarino-schweikert-missed-vote-00364709">one
      missing the vote because they fell asleep in the chambers</a>. Ultimately,
    this bill will hurt the bottom 10% and give massive tax cuts to the top 10%.
    In addition, it will add $3.1 trillion to the debt as it stands and $5.1
    trillion to the debt if the temporary provisions are extended without
    offsets in the next decade.</p>
  <p> The first major aspect of this piece of legislation is the extension of
    the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tax_Cuts_and_Jobs_Act">Tax Cuts
      and Jobs Act</a> passed in 2017. This provision is crucial for Republicans
    because, without an extension of the tax cuts, marginal income tax rates
    will rise next year. Notably, the top marginal tax rate would increase from
    37% for individuals earning over $640,000 to 39.6% for those earning over
    $550,000. Extending the TCJA’s changes to the top tax bracket alone would
    cost the U.S. an estimated $402 billion over the next 10 years.
    Interestingly, President Trump’s proposal to Speaker Mike Johnson to
    increase the top marginal tax rate to 39.6% for those who make over $2.5
    million did not make it into the bill. Additionally, the TCJA’s cuts to the
    lower marginal tax rates—which would continue if the law were extended—do
    little to benefit most Americans. This is because more than 40% of American
    households pay $0 in federal income taxes due to the standard deduction,
    earned income tax credit, and child tax credit. Besides that, Americans
    already had personal exemptions of $4,050 per person in the household in
    2016 which was replaced by a higher standard deduction by the TCJA. The
    standard deduction is currently $15,000, meaning Americans are not taxed on
    their first $15,000 of income. <a
      href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/those-making-450000-and-would-get-nearly-half-benefit-extending-tcja">According
      to the Tax Policy Center,</a> those making more than $450,000 would
    receive more than half of the benefits if the TCJA is extended.
    Additionally, <a
      href="https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2017/12/18/16791174/republican-tax-bill-congress-conference-tax-policy-center">according
      to Vox</a>, if Congress lets the TCJA expire, the TCJA would give 83% of
    its benefits to the top 1% by 2027. Former Vice President Harris’ position
    during the campaign was that the <a
      href="https://taxpolicycenter.org/taxvox/could-harris-tax-increases-pay-her-policy-proposals">TCJA’s
      tax rates should be extended for those making under $400,000 a year.</a>

    2025.</p>

  <p> Besides the extension of the TCJA, the second major aspect of the bill
    includes many new tax breaks. <a
      href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/whats-in-trumps-one-big-beautiful-bill-medicaid-taxes/">The
      child tax credit would temporarily increase from $2,000 to $2,500, before
      returning to $2,000 and being indexed for inflation after 2028</a>. The
    Democratic party would likely agree with this policy, as Harris campaigned
    on increasing the child tax credit to a minimum of $3,000. Other tax changes
    include eliminating taxes on tips, overtime, and adding a $4,000 addition to
    the standard deduction for seniors. Because these tax provisions phase out
    for high-income earners, it seems likely that the Democratic Party would
    support them. Notably, all <a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/politics/2025/05/21/no-tax-on-tips-act-passes-senate/">Senate
      Democrats voted in favor of the No Tax on Tips Act</a>, which passed the
    Senate on May 20th. However, many Americans may be opposed to no tax on tips
    due to the possibility of tipped workers receiving less raises from the
    employer due to their employees receiving more in tips. In addition, all
    three tax policies are discriminating against those who do not receive tips,
    overtime, and are not seniors. After all, tips, overtime, and seniors’
    income are all subject to the standard deduction already. Furthermore, <a
      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/05/22/salt-deduction-trump-tax-bill.html">it
      also raises the SALT deduction cap imposed by the TCJA from $10,000 to
      $40,000.</a> The SALT (<strong>S</strong>tate <strong>A</strong>nd
    <strong>L</strong>ocal <strong>T</strong>ax) deduction is an itemized
    deduction for those who pay higher local taxes. In theory, the SALT
    deduction would save many low-income people from paying both federal and
    local taxes. However, since the standard deduction is higher now due to the
    TCJA, at $15,000, individuals would only take the SALT deduction if their
    total itemized deductions plus the SALT deduction is over $15,000. For
    instance, the effective state and local tax rate in the highest taxed state
    in the country, New York, is 15.9%. For those making $80,000 a year in New
    York, the amount of tax they would pay is approximately $12,720. So unless
    this person claimed $2,280 in additional itemized deductions, they would
    take the standard deduction instead. In fact, in New York, to even begin
    receiving the benefits of the SALT deduction if you only itemize with SALT,
    you would have to make approximately $95,000. Therefore, the SALT deduction
    only helps those who make over ~$100,000. The new SALT cap would begin to
    phase out at $500,000, meaning those making between $100,000-$500,000 would
    receive the biggest tax break due to this change. It should be noted that
    many Democratic and Republican congress members in blue states have opposed
    the $10,000 SALT cap because blue states tend to have higher state and local
    taxes.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Besides the tax changes in the bill, it would also make drastic changes to
    public assistance programs, <a
      href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/republican-house-bill-medicaid-snap-cuts-tax-cut-trump-rcna208380">most
      notably Medicaid and SNAP</a>. The bill would institute work requirements
    for Medicaid recipients, require more checks to make sure those on Medicaid
    are still eligible, restrict states’ use of provider taxes to pay their
    share of Medicaid costs, and slash Medicaid funding for states that offer
    separate health insurance for unauthorized immigrants. The work requirement
    for Medicaid would require those who are on Medicaid to prove they are
    eligible via extra steps that are not needed. Additionally, work
    requirements for Medicaid ignores the fact that health problems affect
    whether people can work, and that only <a
      href="https://www.kff.org/medicaid/issue-brief/understanding-the-intersection-of-medicaid-and-work-an-update/">8%
      of Medicaid covered adults (age 19-64) are not working due to retirement,
      inability to find work, or another reason.</a> The Congressional Budget
    Office (CBO) has estimated that restricting states’ use of provider taxes to
    finance Medicaid would lead to reduced Medicaid coverage, <a
      href="https://www.cbo.gov/system/files/2025-05/Wyden-Pallone_Letter.pdf">as
      states would likely respond by cutting Medicaid spending.</a>
    Additionally, it appears highly contradictory for the party that champions
    “states’ rights” to restrict states’ ability to impose taxes on “health care
    items or services or entities that provide or pay for health care items or
    services.” The same goes for the provision that reduces Medicaid expansion
    federal matching funds from 90% to 80% for states that provide their own
    state health program for unauthorized immigrants. According to the CBO, 10.3
    million people would lose Medicaid, (about 1/7th of all Americans on
    Medicaid), and 7.6 million would be uninsured due to this bill. In addition
    to the changes made to Medicaid, the bill also makes significant changes to
    SNAP. The bill would tighten the existing work requirements by raising the
    age of able-bodied people to receive SNAP benefits from 54 to 64. <a
      href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/05/22/congress/house-budget-bill-would-cut-millions-of-people-from-food-aid-cbo-says-00366842">This
      would cut $92 billion from SNAP and force 3.2 million Americans off the
      program.</a></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In addition to the disastrous cuts already mentioned, it also cuts clean
    energy spending from the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Inflation_Reduction_Act">Inflation
      Reduction Act</a>, signed into law by President Biden, spending that is
    fully paid for. The bill would <a
      href="https://yaleclimateconnections.org/2025/05/one-big-beautiful-climate-killing-bill/">end
      the electric vehicle tax credit on December 31, 2025,</a> except for
    automakers that have sold fewer than 200,000 qualifying vehicles between
    2010 and the end of this year. For those manufacturers, the credit would
    expire on December 31, 2026. It would also end the used EV, commercial EV,
    and residential EV charger tax credits by the end of this year.
    Additionally, it proposes an early phase out of the subsidies for wind,
    solar, energy storage, advanced nuclear, and geothermal energy. It also
    proposes repealing the Energy Efficiency Home Improvement Credit, which
    provides a tax credit for heat pumps, and the Residential Clean Energy
    Credit which offers homeowners 30% off the cost of solar panels and battery
    systems to store energy from solar panels.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>While the cuts are bad, they may not be the worst of it. A provision in the
    bill would restrict the judicial branches’ ability to hold government
    officials in contempt when they violate court orders. To quote <a
      href="https://www.justsecurity.org/113529/terrible-idea-contempt-court/">Erwin
      Chemerinsky, Professor of Law at UC Berkeley</a>; “the bill is stunning in
    its scope. It would apply to all temporary restraining orders, preliminary
    injunctions, and even permanent injunctions <em>ever </em>issued. By its
    terms, it applies to court orders “issued prior to, on, or subsequent” to
    its adoption.” If you’ve been following the administration’s court battles
    so far, you’d know TRO’s and preliminary injunctions have been critical to
    slowing down some of the <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/09/nx-s1-5393777/trump-rifs-court-mass-layoff-doge">Trump
      admin’s worst initiatives</a>. Just this past Friday <a
      href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2025/5/23/harvard-international-students-tro/">a
      federal judge issued a TRO to block Trump from blocking Harvard’s ability
      to enroll international students.</a> Chemerinsky states that “Without the
    ability to enforce judicial orders, they (federal courts) are rendered mere
    advisory opinions which parties are free to disregard.” </p>

      changing how student loans work</a>, this bill lives up to the “big” part
    of its name. The bill has to pass the Senate, where Republicans have already
    been <a

      about the need for adjustments</a>. However, Republicans have a 53-47
    majority, and only 51 votes are needed to pass this bill. With a deadline of
    July 4th, <a href="https://www.congress.gov/members/find-your-member">now is
      the time to call your senator</a>, especially if you live in a red state.
    If the bill passes as is, millions will lose food stamps, millions more will
    lose healthcare coverage, and all of us will be one step closer to a full on
    dictatorship. </p>
