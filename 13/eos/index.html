  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

      Order 14294 - Fighting Overcriminalization in Federal Regulations</a></p>
  <p>Signed: May 9, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 14, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 lays out some rote whining about how many regulations there are
    in the US law code that we have seen in many other EOs from this
    Administration. The only real difference this time is it seems to complain
    specifically about enforcement of the law against criminal violations of
    regulations.. </p>
  <p>Section 2 states it is US policy that “criminal enforcement of criminal
    regulatory offenses is disfavored”, which is difficult to parse, but I
    believe means bringing criminal charges for the violation of regulations is
    disfavored. It also says that Prosecution should only happen to people that
    know or should have known they are violating a criminal regulation. It also
    talks about how strict liability is generally disfavored.</p>
  <p>Section 3 lays out definitions for the EO.</p>
  <p>Section 4 requires agency heads to identify the criminal regulations under
    their purview and the punishments that could possibly result from a
    violation of said regulations.</p>
  <p>Section 5 requires all future notices of proposed rulemaking include a
    statement as to the criminality of the regulation proposed, and the mens rea
    required for the proposed regulation. It reiterates that strict liability is
    disfavored, and new strict liability regulations require approval by the
    Office of Information and Regulatory Affairs.</p>
  <p>Section 6 directs heads of each agency to try and change the mens rea of
    any criminal regulations to require knowledge of violation of the
    regulation. </p>
  <p>Section 7 requires each agency head to publish guidance for addressing
    criminally liable regulatory offenses.</p>
  <p>Section 8 states that the EO does not affect immigration or national
    security related regulations.</p>
  <p><strong>What it Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO attempts to change the intent or mens rea requirement for criminal
    violations of regulations. In most cases, a prosecutor only needs to show
    that the accused intended to take the alleged action, but not that they
    knowingly broke the law. In some cases the act, regardless of the intention,
    alone is sufficient to lead to a conviction. Now this EO attempts to make it
    where not only does the intent of the actor matter, but their knowledge of
    whether they are violating the law must be proved to lead to a conviction.
    This is a much higher evidentiary burden, and makes it less likely that
    these kinds of cases will even be initiated.</p>

    papers representing the government regulations of the 1960s and the
    regulations of today back in 2017 (Saul Loeb / AFP - Getty Images)</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>While this EO tries to change the evidentiary standards for pleadings, EOs
    are in no way controlling for how criminal violations are litigated.
    Statutes and case law decide how these laws are adjudicated and the
    evidentiary burdens to prove guilt. The only thing this EO can directly
    affect is how the DOJ decides to bring cases against regulators. Now, the
    DOJ must plead this much higher standard in court, and is not allowed to
    merely show intent of the alleged action, it must show knowledge. It is
    similar to tying a hand behind your back before entering a fight. The DOJ
    will be less likely to bring a criminal regulatory case in the future, and
    if they do choose to bring any, they will be less likely to succeed.</p>

      Order 14295 - Increasing Efficiency at the Office of the Federal
      Register</a></p>
  <p>Signed: May 9, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 14, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 reiterates how important deregulation is to this Administration.
    It appears the Administration has been getting my letters, and published my
    complaints about the delay in publishing EOs and other documents submitted
    to the Federal Register. It also complains about the serious cost each
    agency faces of $151-$174 per column of text for such submissions.</p>
  <p>Section 2 orders the Archivist to modernize computer systems and eliminate
    unnecessary bureaucracy and lower the publication time of submissions.</p>
  <p><strong>What it Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is ordering changes in the Federal Register, the organization that
    maintains the official records for governmental acts. Laws, EOs, memoranda,
    and other official written public documents are maintained in the Federal
    Register. As discussed in the EO, publication of such materials is often
    delayed by a week or so, and costs the agencies applying for publication a
    nominal fee. This Administration is frustrated by this for some reason, and
    have made an EO to change this.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>The Federal Register might publish things sooner and have less funding,
    though these might be at odds and defeat any attempted improvement at
    efficiency before it can be implemented.</p>

      Order 14296 - Keeping Promises to Veterans and Establishing a National
      Center for Warrior Independence</a></p>
  <p>Signed: May 9, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 14, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 talks about how veterans aren’t treated well in America. It also
    shits on the VA a bit. </p>
  <p>Section 2 orders the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to build a shelter for
    homeless veterans in VA. It also reroutes funds that would be spent on
    helping veterans, and instead forces it be spent on this homeless vet
    shelter.</p>
  <p>Section 3 wants the Secretary of Housing and Urban Development to develop
    vouchers to help the homeless (It’s not clear what this is referencing).</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders the VA to go after employees and individuals who have
    committed misconduct “and fire employees rehired in the previous
    administration that had been fired for misconduct and direct such savings
    back towards care, benefits, and services for veterans, in accordance with
    all applicable laws.” (I think they didn’t bother to proof this for some
    reason, I promise I’m trying to make this section make sense but idk man).
  </p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the Secretary to increase the options for care, benefits,
    and services for veterans. It also orders various executive officers to make
    a report or strategy regarding making the VA more efficient.</p>
  <p><strong>What it Means</strong></p>
  <p>This appears to be a boondoggle wrapped up in a bunch of virtue signaling
    about veterans. While it makes vague language about making the VA more
    efficient and firing employees who have committed misconduct, it’s not clear
    how any of this will actually make a difference to help veterans. Meanwhile
    a significant amount of funds will be used in building some kind of massive
    facility in LA to help homeless veterans. </p>

    <span class="caption">Image 2</span>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>This is likely nothing more than legacy building by trump. Building a
    massive facility that Trump can put his name on or at the very least use for
    photo ops to aggrandize himself. It is unlikely that any real progress on
    the issues that the VA faces will be addressed, though Trump and his
    supporters will be loath to acknowledge this. Meanwhile, the facility being
    built might possibly help homeless veterans in LA, but it does nothing to
    help homeless veterans in the rest of the country. </p>

      Order 14297 - Delivering Most-Favored-Nation Prescription Drug Pricing to
      American Patients</a></p>
  <p>Signed: May 12, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 15, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 gets mad about how much the US spends on (prescription) drugs and
    at pharmaceutical companies.</p>
  <p>Section 2 says that Americans shouldn’t subsidize foreign drug prices.</p>
  <p>Section 3 orders various executive officers to ensure foreign countries
    aren’t taking steps to force Americans to pay for too much drugs. No real
    course of action or method to achieve this is discussed, just a vague order.
  </p>
  <p>Section 4 the Secretary of HHS is to facilitate direct-to-consumer sales of
    drugs at most-favored-nation prices.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders various executive officers to try to negotiate (with no
    identified leverage) to bring down drug prices to be at most-favored-nation
    prices. </p>
  <p><strong>What it Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is the result of Trump’s obsession with equalizing prices of
    American pharmaceuticals with other nations’ lower prices. This EO attempts
    to prevent pharmaceutical companies from using regional pricing. It also
    only discusses the prices of medications in the terms of direct sales rather
    than prices within Medicaid/Medicare.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>This EO will do very little to help the people spend the most on
    pharmaceuticals. It tries to change the price of drugs for out of pocket
    purchases, not drugs purchased that are covered by insurance. This is
    important, because if it had been for the ACA it would have raised the
    minimum coverage required for Employer provided health insurance. This is
    why the IRA’s prescription drug negotiation language was so impactful under
    the previous Administration. The ACA increasing its coverage or lowering its
    prices is a tide that raises all boats, and this EO intentionally avoids
    doing so. This EO also does not identify any leverage or powers that the
    government has to enforce these price changes. While there has been much
    fanfare about this EO, it is not clear how it will ever actually achieve its
    goals of lower drug prices and helping the average American.</p>
