  <p>In 2024 I went diving in Burrows Pass in the Puget Sound with my brother
    and another friend. The location has a stunning wall and a lot of life, and
    we were excited and eager to dive it. Burrows Pass is a fairly narrow
    channel and experiences high currents at tide changes. Diving these types of
    channels safely not only requires a good technical knowledge of currents and
    tides, but thorough planning and execution born out of experience conducting
    these kinds of dives. All three of us are certified and fairly experienced
    divers, two of us with the bulk of our dives in cold water, and all of us
    having dove in high current areas. But there were some blind spots. None of
    us have dove this spot before, none of us had planned a dive in an area as
    sensitive to currents as this, and one of us (my brother) had never dove
    cold water before. My friend and I looked at the tide and current
    predictions, read up on other divers reports and recommendations, and
    planned a dive with fairly tight timetables. Almost immediately the dive
    started to go wrong.</p>

  </div> - <em>Dive location. The goal was to get to the wall to the left near
    Fidalgo Head following the route in red, starting at the beach off Cabana
    Park.</em></p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>My brother, who is a capable diver, had not dove in a cold-water
    environment before and the different buoyancy profile from 7-14 mm thick
    wetsuit and increased lead weights resulted in him struggling to maintain
    neutral buoyancy and control underwater. This delayed us pretty severely on
    our timetable. We lingered around the beginning portion of the dive trying
    to get a good look at a giant pacific octopus (under Washington park
    overview in the image above), while he adjusted and got used to the new
    buoyancy profile, my friend and I changed plans and decided that we would
    cut down time at the wall to compensate and keep us within our timetable.
    After we felt comfortable to continue on, something changed. We noticed we
    were beginning to move very quickly. Realizing that the current was picking
    up before we anticipated, we dropped to the rocks below, braced and began to
    head back to shore. The high current killed any visibility making movement
    akin to driving through a blizzard. Realizing how easy it would be to get
    separated, and my friend having already lost visual contact with me and my
    brother, we surfaced. What followed was an hour-long slog to fight the
    current 100 feet to the shore where we started. We made it back exhausted
    and apprehensive that we had just narrowly dodged getting swept out into the
    open sound.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The ones who planned the dive, me and my friend, had a surface level
    understanding of the currents and tides in the Puget Sound, but not a
    practical or technical knowledge of how they behave in environments like
    Burrows Pass. We could have consulted our dive plan with people we know who
    had either the expertise and/or experience with the site on our plan, but we
    didn't. We could have planned a dive at a spot known to us for my brother to
    get used to the new buoyancy profile before diving the pass, but we didn't.
    In short, we assumed our experience in one thing was good enough and thought
    we could impose that experience on a new environment without the
    intellectual humility to accept we would have to learn and change to
    accomplish the goal of diving that wall safely. We were fortunate that one
    mistake saved us from the worst consequences of the other, as without the
    delay we would have been significantly farther out when the current picked
    up, potentially in water too deep to brace at the bottom and too far out to
    swim against the current that would only build in strength. We were lucky,
    plain and simple. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This personal experience of overcalculating my abilities and skills to
    complete a task I understood poorly is something I have been thinking about
    a lot lately. There seems to be an epidemic of assuming one's skillset is
    "good enough" and applicable to areas outside where it was developed. The
    federal government is rank with it, many private industries are, to their
    detriment, infested with it, and online spaces are so subsumed by it that it
    makes my head spin. This is not a new problem. This tendency of humans to
    apply what they know to what they don't know probably goes back to our
    earliest development as a species and is not inherently a bad thing.
    Sometimes it can be a necessary part of learning, but if you do not have the
    intellectual humility to recognize that your own deficiency has resulted in
    a bad outcome you cannot reform it, and you will only prolong and/or
    exacerbate it.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This systemic problem has recently come to a head in my professional life.
    I am a fluids analyst (well now they renamed everyone to propulsion
    engineer) working in rocket propulsion. The company I work for has had a
    long history of mismanagement and there has undoubtedly been a need to
    reorganize things here. We have long had issues of poor communication, slow
    and poor decision making, and a poor utilization of the manpower available.
    No one I know would agree that the way things were structured before were
    good. But now new leadership is trying to implement agile/scrum across all
    programs, and it has been paralyzing. As a disclaimer I am not
    anti-agile/scrum. I think the software industry evolved an organizational
    structure that has worked phenomenally well for a lot of companies. It is an
    emergent system from a low capital investment and astronomically high margin
    industry. But going back to the theme of the story I gave in the beginning,
    sometimes processes and mechanics are too dissimilar for practices to remain
    the same. And that is definitely the issue we are running into on the engine
    program I am assigned to. A rocket engine is an extremely complex coupled
    system. You change one thing; it affects everything else. It makes it a very
    tedious process to develop and change things. When the production, design,
    and analysis teams are all on different spirit schedules, all dependent on
    each other and all have reduced communication with each other, it leaves us
    all confused, less coherent and less likely to change course. Everything
    about rocket engines is at odds with software. Software is generally cheap
    to test; a rocket engine is horribly expensive to test. Software development
    (usually) requires a relatively smaller skillset from the people developing
    it, a rocket engine requires a wide diversity of disciplines ranging from
    production engineers to thermal analysts to systems analysts and much more.
    This isn't to denigrate software as "easy", that is a demonstrably false
    sentiment, it is just a fundamentally different process.</p>

    <span class="caption"><em>High level engine diagram of a Raptor 3 engine. While other engines
      use different engine cycles, they generally share the complexity and are
      all coupled systems. For example the fuel used in the preburner that
      powers the pump that pressurizes the fuel needs to be heated by running it
      through channels in the nozzle and combustion chamber walls. This also
      keeps the engine from exploding. </em></span>
  </div>
  <p>Right now we are trying to define stories for 2-week sprints and the
    problems we are running into is that all our work runs at drastically
    different timescales. A fluids analysis can vary drastically in the time it
    takes to conduct it, which makes it difficult to work in the same time
    frames as other forms of analysis, it’s also difficult to break up an
    analysis into multiple stories as there is complex and coupled interplay
    into prepossessing, running, analyzing and documenting an analysis on fluid
    system. This problem is only exacerbated as different types of analysis are
    dependent on each other, or as test data is needed before continuing, or as
    when rubber hits the road in manufacturing, things change. This creates a
    highly dynamic coupled environment where everything is dependent on each
    other, and everything runs on different timescales. Now as some have pointed
    out, the principles of agile are not contrary to the environment I am
    describing, but the organization that is being imposed on us is. We are
    spending almost as much time trying to figure out how many story points a
    task is as we are doing it. Maybe I'm just a pessimistic hater, but in our
    attempts to be more efficient, we are instead creating a system to distill
    our progress into a single number devoid of context or meaning to the upper
    leadership it is meant for. There is a new organizational orthodoxy in town,
    and it cracked immediately under pressure. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This story is a common one. It happened at Boeing with its slow death
    spiral after its merger with McDonnell Douglas. Leadership from McDonnell
    Douglas implemented policies that forced them into a financial situation
    where Boeing could acquire them, spawning the saying that McDonnell Douglas
    bought Boeing with Boeing's money [1]. This is the same story happening in
    the federal government. Everyone can agree that it needs reform and more
    effective organizations, but those tasked with implementing that are showing
    the same signs of imposing their idea of what something is rather than
    learning what it is. You can see it at DOGE, where decisions are made before
    information is looked at [2]. You can see it in our foreign policy as people
    with a juvenile or non-existent understanding of the countries they are
    dealing with and their past history with the United States fumbles and
    bumble trade agreements to peace deals [3]. You can see it in HHS as a brain
    damaged RFK jr. enacts into policy whatever schizophrenic conspiracy theory
    bounces off the void in his brain [4]. There is an entirely new slate of
    people, some successful and capable in their own fields previously, imposing
    their own particular orthodoxy onto the federal government. </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In the DoD it seems anything not fitting what Hegseth's view of a
    "warfighter" is considered counterproductive, regardless of what its
    function actually is. A great example of this is the recent slashing of the
    staff colleges and the office of net assessment [5]. The staff officer
    college system has been one of the great success stories of the American
    alliance network. It facilitates cross training between allied militaries
    and helps integration and understanding of the nation’s we have fought with
    in the past and may fight with in the future. It expands the officer core’s
    skill sets so that they have a more nuanced understanding of the world they
    will deal with. While its reduction in scope and scale is expected from
    their ideological outlook, the loss of the office of net assessment was
    shocking. Their objective was to study and analyze current weapon systems,
    foreign and domestic, to predict and plan the development of current and
    future weapons systems. Things like how to develop and use the emerging
    drone and information warfare systems, like what we have seen in the Ukraine
    war, were its mission. It is baffling that an administration whose goal is
    to implement more drone technology would dismantle an organization in line
    with its goals. It leads me to believe that Hegseth had no idea what it was
    when he axed the organization. His approach is eerily reminiscent of many in
    leadership of the militaries going into the first world war, of imposing a
    romantic past on a fundamentally different present that they did not
    understand. And millions paid the price for it. </p>

  <p>Now does this mean that outsiders coming into new fields is bad? Of course
    not. There is as long a list of outsiders being a net positive to a field as
    a detriment. In a recent conversation I had with a coworker he communicated
    that one of the best program managers he has ever had was someone with no
    experience with the program he was managing. He was an Airforce major with
    some background in electrical engineering, but no experience with rotating
    detonation engines. But he knew what he knew and more importantly, what he
    didn't. He learned and adapted his management to the new environment. Now he
    did not become a subject matter expert in rotating detonation engines, it
    would be unreasonable to expect that but learning to trust the subject
    matter experts he managed and the engineers learning to trust him were
    imperative to his ability to manage them. That trust allowed him to learn
    and adapt himself so that he could manage and direct the engineers under his
    management and keep the program on track. Outsiders and new ideas are not
    bad; it's the delusion of "pre-understanding" and imposition of orthodoxy
    that is so damaging. An orthodoxy of process constrains novelty and
    ingenuity in solving problems and carrying out tasks.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>There are ominous clouds on the horizon of the United States and the rest
    of the world. There is a growing need for people who are willing to modify
    their own practices to the new environments and are not constrained by the
    orthodoxy of “but it worked before here”. That is the danger of orthodoxy of
    all types, orthodoxy is brittle, it is unable to bend to shift to increased
    pressure. The embrittling of seemingly everything in our government and
    corporate sectors is a real trend and as global and domestic pressure
    mounts, expect things to crack.</p>
