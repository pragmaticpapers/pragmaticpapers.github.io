    orders when they believe that certain actions are unconstitutional. Now, the
    Roberts Court assesses whether or not to keep that right.</h3>

  <p>On January 20th, the Trump administration underwent one of their first of
    many constitutional crises. With the signing of Executive Order 14160,
    inaptly titled “Protecting the Meaning and Value of American Citizenship,“
    the Trump administration fundamentally turned the 14th Amendment on its
    head, challenging the long-held assumption that anyone born on United States
    soil enjoys the privileges of American citizenship. This order commanded
    executive agencies to immediately refuse to recognize the citizenship of
    people who received their citizenship via the 14th Amendment. Birthright
    citizenship differentiates the New World from the Old; a system of <em>jus
      soli</em> citizenship revolutionized the world and the relationship
    between the populace and government. By not withholding citizenship from
    those who previously would have been rejected, the Western world defined
    itself as a home for many disenfranchised peoples. In effect, birthright
    citizenship is one of the many values that defines America as a “Western”
    nation. At least it did for a while.</p>
  <p>This did not go as easily as the administration would have hoped, however.
    Numerous district court judges used their powers to issue preliminary
    injunctions, effectively telling the White House that they could not go
    through with this blatantly unconstitutional act. The injunctions issued by
    lower district court judges regarding birthright citizenship is part of a
    wider attempt by judges nationwide to use their power to stop the
    administration from violating the virtues of the Constitution; Trump’s
    commitment to laying-off thousands of federal employees, deporting migrants,
    and freezing funds has been halted in large part by the ability of lower
    district court judges to issue these universal injunctions. The Trump
    administration finds these attempts by judges to be “judicial overreach”
    (even though they largely defended the same tactic being used against
    Biden’s student loan reform) and are steadfast in going through with their
    policies.</p>
  <p>Numerous lawsuits were presented, including one from “CASA de Maryland,” an
    immigrants-rights organization committed to defending the virtues of
    birthright citizenship in the United States. Their assertion is that the
    executive order strips the constitutionally-guaranteed right to birthright
    citizenship from hundreds of thousands of Americans.</p>
  <p>All of this culminated on May 15, when the Supreme Court heard arguments
    from the US solicitor general Dean John Sauer, New Jersey solicitor general
    Jeremy Feigenbaum, and representative from CASA and other immigrant-rights
    groups Kelsi B. Corkran.</p>
  <p><em>Trump v. CASA</em> does not just touch on the sanctity of birthright
    citizenship as an American concept enshrined in our founding document. The
    case goes even farther, defining the limitations that lower circuit judges
    have come to know as one of their premier and defining duties. The outcome
    of this case does not just affect the children of non-citizens born on US
    soil, but the nation as a whole, as well as the ability for our judicial
    branch to have oversight on our executive.</p>
  <p><strong>Universal Injunctions In The First Trump Administration</strong>
  </p>
  <p>While the definition of a “nationwide injunction” can be deduced through
    its own name, its practice in American history gives us a glimpse into the
    abilities, virtues, and overall understanding of the action. By looking at
    nationwide injunctions that were issued in the first Trump administration,
    we can learn how the current President made it a focal point of his
    degradation of judicial powers and seeing lower court judges as adversaries
    who must be defeated, rather than allies in the common goal of upholding the
    Constitution.</p>
  <p>It seems like decades ago when Trump’s ramblings about banning travel from
    majority-Muslim countries metastasized into a full-on executive order. On
    January 27, 2017, President Donald Trump signed Executive Order 13769, also
    known as the “Muslim Ban.” Western District of Washington judge James L.
    Robart issued a nationwide injunction on the order, saying that it does not
    defend or protect the national security interests Republicans imbued as not
    being aptly protected. Following the injunction, President Trump signed
    Executive Order 13780, titled “Protecting the Nation from Foreign Terrorist
    Entry into the United States,” or more commonly referred to as “Travel Ban
    2.0.” This time, District of Hawaii court judge Derrick Watson issued a
    nationwide injunction in order to delay the implementation of this order.
  </p>
  <p>Eventually, the Supreme Court allowed the executive order to go into
    effect, essentially ending the attempts that Robart and Watson put into
    motion. However, these were not the only universal injunctions issued during
    Trump’s first term. Attempts to withhold funding from sanctuary cities, ban
    transgender individuals from military service, and changing DACA
    requirements all were held up in courts by district judges through universal
    injunctions. Overall, 55 injunctions were issued against Trump during his
    first administration; this is more than all of the injunctions issued during
    the Obama and Biden presidencies combined. Obviously, Trump knew that in his
    return to the White House, he was going to have to limit the ability of
    lower district judges to delay his agenda.</p>
  <p><strong><em>Trump v. CASA</em></strong></p>
  <p>The case argued in the Supreme Court today asks a simple question: does a
    district court judge have the range to block the enforcement of an executive
    order to parties that were not involved in the suit? While birthright
    citizenship is the vehicle for which the argument is being made, the meat of
    the substance revolves around the question of universal injunctions. On a
    personal level, while I value the importance of birthright citizenship, I
    believe the ability of lower court judges to temporarily halt executive
    actions is a key part of our separation of powers and arguably, a much more
    impactful aspect of this case than that of birthright citizenship.</p>
  <p>To summarize some of the key aspects of the oral arguments, one has to
    start with Justice Elena Kagan, who ferociously ripped into the US solicitor
    general with an argument specifically regarding the range that district
    court judges possess. By pointing out that, if the government loses cases
    that only specifically target plaintiffs, why would anyone ever appeal to
    the Supreme Court? Would that not weaken the institution to a degree that it
    cripples it from all of the power that it needs to function?</p>
  <p>Even Justice Kavanaugh, a Trump appointee, had some specific issues with
    the merits of the birthright citizenship aspect of the case. Kavanaugh
    pointed out the issues regarding ambiguity of citizenship for certain
    newborns at time of birth, asking “what do hospitals do with a newborn? What
    do states do with a newborn?” The US solicitor general’s answer was less
    than ideal, basically adding to the fire of uncertainty by saying that
    “federal officials will have to figure that out.”</p>

  </div>
  <p>Overall, the specific aspects of the birthright citizenship aspect of the
    case were less touched up on, and will probably not be the main cause of
    deliberation for the justices. Furthermore, the Supreme Court reaffirmed the
    14th Amendment’s commitment to birthright citizenship in the landmark case
    <em>United States v. Wong Kim Ark </em>(1898). Personally, I do not see the
    Supreme Court doing away with birthright citizenship, as every justice
    (except for Thomas) seems to have very little faith in the merits of the
    case brought forth by the government. The issue about universal injunctions
    is a lot more testy and could potentially have wide-ranging impact.</p>
  <p><strong>Judges Thoughts on Universal Injunctions</strong></p>
  <p>The justices that make up the Roberts Court have a history of not fully
    supporting the institution of universal injunctions. Most noteworthy is
    Justice Thomas’ opinion regarding such injunctions, specifically found in
    the presiding arguments for <em>Trump v. Hawaii</em> (2018). Justice Thomas
    wrote in his concurring opinion:</p>
  <p>Merits aside, I write separately to address the remedy that the plaintiffs
    sought and obtained in this case. The District Court imposed an injunction
    that barred the Government from enforcing the President’s Proclamation
    against anyone, not just the plaintiffs. Injunctions that prohibit the
    Executive Branch from applying a law or policy against anyone—often called
    “universal” or “nationwide” injunctions—have become increasingly common.
    District courts, including the one here, have begun imposing universal
    injunctions without considering their authority to grant such sweeping
    relief. These injunctions are beginning to take a toll on the federal court
    system— preventing legal questions from percolating through the federal
    courts, encouraging forum shopping, and making every case a national
    emergency for the courts and for the Executive Branch</p>
  <p>He goes onto develop his assertion that the use of nationwide injunctions
    is a more contemporary invention, and that its use might stray further from
    the beliefs of the framers than one would have hoped. He notes:</p>
  <p>These injunctions are a recent development, emerging for the first time in
    the 1960s and dramatically increasing in popularity only very recently. And
    they appear to conflict with several traditional rules of equity, as well as
    the original understanding of the judicial role.</p>
  <p>To the extent that nationwide injunctions are a “recent development,”
    Justice Thomas is not totally wrong. However, there are some early 20th
    century court cases that showcase the constitutionality and legality of
    these actions, such as <em>Lewis Publishing Co. v. Morgan</em> in 1913 and
    <em>Frothingham v. Mellon </em>in 1923. While the frequency of these
    injunctions have picked up since the 1960s (in large part because of the New
    Deal), the practice is by no means a “recent development” as Thomas asserts
    in his concurring opinion.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, Justice Gorsuch has also written about the institution in
    previous opinions, most notably his concurring opinion in <em>Department of
      Homeland Security v. New York </em>(2020). Gorsuch writes:</p>
  <p>Whether framed as injunctions of “nationwide,” “universal,” or “cosmic”
    scope, these orders share the same basic flaw—they direct how the defendant
    must act toward persons who are not parties to the case… Injunctions like
    these thus raise serious questions about the scope of courts’ equitable
    powers under Article III.</p>
  <p>He furthers this claim, arguing that nationwide injunctions deteriorate and
    destruct the very duties of the judicial branch and its relationship with
    the Executive. He writes:</p>
  <p>As the brief and furious history of the regulation before us illustrates,
    the routine issuance of universal injunctions is patently unworkable, sowing
    chaos for litigants, the government, courts, and all those affected by these
    conflicting decisions.</p>
  <p>Other justices have not had such scornful or outward views regarding the
    use of universal injunctions. It would be fair to say (by viewing similar
    cases) that Justices Roberts, Kavanaugh, Alito, and Barrett are similarly
    positioned in their dislike for these actions. On the contrary, Justices
    Sotomayor, Kagan, and Jackson are more likely to support universal
    injunctions, seeing as they uphold it even when it juxtaposes with their
    ideological preferences, such as in the student loan injunctions filed
    during the Biden administration.</p>
  <p>All of these arguments miss a key factor regarding the institution as a
    whole, and their implementation today. The Trump administration is historic
    in their blatant disregard for the Constitution. Now more than ever,
    district court judges have to place roadblocks wherever they see fit in
    order to delay and defy actions that are incongruent with our founding
    document. This can be done through universal injunctions.</p>
  <p><strong>Matter of the Fact: The Current Administration</strong></p>
  <p>In Trump’s first 100 days in office, district court judges issued a
    collective 25 nationwide injunctions. The reasons for this can be boiled
    down to a simple question of “chicken or the egg;” do our district court
    judges have an impulse to bring down the authority of the Executive and
    assert the supremacy of the Judiciary? Or are Trump’s actions
    record-breaking and whiplashing in their unconstitutionality? In my opinion,
    the latter holds more weight when assessing the reasons behind the high
    number of universal injunctions.</p>
  <p>Going through every single constitutional crisis during Trump’s first 100
    days in detail requires a written work all on its own. Donald Trump and his
    sycophantic administration have fired thousands of government employees,
    inspectors generals, and other impartial watchdogs. The administration has
    done away with entire government agencies such as USAID and the Department
    of Education. They have deported individuals without due process, withheld
    funding from congressionally allocated projects, targeted law firms, and
    gave access to classified internal payment systems to the richest man on the
    planet. While all of these actions are harmful on their own, the added fact
    that he isn’t <em>allowed</em> to do any of this is groundbreaking. He
    usurps the legislation-making powers of Congress and puffs his chest out at
    members of the Judiciary who take issue with these actions. At the heart of
    the issue is a President who is grossly overstepping his duties, and
    constantly casting off the restraints that make us a Constitutional
    democracy.</p>
  <p><strong>The Merits of the Institution</strong></p>
  <p>Many people have genuine concerns regarding the validity of universal
    injunctions. And to a certain extent, I agree; why can a district court
    judge in Seattle or Honolulu override the Executive power of the President
    of the United States? Why can a single person, who mostly presides over
    decisions regarding prisoner petitions and social security appeals, tell the
    President to delay their policy agenda? Is this system not ripe for abuse?
    Will I, as a Democrat, not be upset whenever a future President of my liking
    gets all of their executive orders held up in court?</p>
  <p>The answer to these questions is two-pronged: yes, the institution is not
    perfect. It is able to be abused and does show that the Judicial branch has
    some level of supremacy over the Executive branch. But district court judges
    do not deny the ability for Presidents to issue executive orders— they
    ensure that these orders pass through judicial scrutiny and are adherent to
    the tenets of the Constitution. The Executive branch does not have the
    legislative back-and-forth that Congress has. The Supreme Court does not
    have the time to look over every single executive order to ensure that it is
    up to the standards of the law. District judges, nationwide, have the
    ability and the duty to ensure that our Executive branch is following their
    duty. Now, more than ever, do we see this system not being abused, but used
    to defend our institutions.</p>
  <p>One might say, “while district court judges do have a say in
    Executive-branch policy, can they really issue injunctions that affect
    non-plaintiffs?” My answer to this sincere question is that, in cases where
    the civil rights of individuals are at stake (such as in this birthright
    citizenship case) the duty to adhere to the Constitution does not fall
    solely with those who prosecute or defend. The duty is to every American,
    and when an Executive as brazen and unforgiving as Trump holds onto the
    reins of power, the ability to do damage to citizens and non-citizens alike
    exponentially increases when cases are held up in the court system while the
    implementation of their specific policies goes underway.</p>
  <p>We currently do not know what the outcome of <em>Trump v. CASA </em>will
    be. The Roberts Court seems unsympathetic to the government’s arguments
    regarding birthright citizenship; meanwhile, prominent conservative voices
    on the bench find the institution of universal injunctions to be contrary to
    their relationship with the Executive branch.</p>
  <p>While these issues are serious and must be treated with care, it is
    important to recognize the truth of the situation. In the White House sits a
    man with little regard for the Constitution and for the restraints placed
    upon his office. He passes executive orders with little care (or
    understanding) for their adherence to constitutionality. District court
    judges, from around the nation, have been doing their due diligence in
    delaying these executive orders, and to let analysts of the Constitution do
    their bidding. This power must not be stripped from them. The Supreme Court
    must do the right thing and allow for universal injunctions to continue to
    cast a check on the President. A thorn in the side of a tyrant might not
    stop them entirely, but it ensures their inability to rapidly push
    legislation that hurts Americans.</p>
