  <p>Stand Up! Fighting Illiberalism: Protests in Slovakia and Hungary </p>
  <p>Thomas R Ullmann </p>
  <p>June 1, 2025 </p>
  <p><strong>The background, an ironic history </strong></p>
  <p>In the popular imagination of the Cold War, both Czechoslovakia (comprising
    modern day Czech Republic and Slovakia) and Hungary stood out as the most
    restless and rebellious nations behind the Iron Curtain. Czechoslovaks
    poured into the streets during the <em>Prague Spring </em>of 1968 against
    dictatorship, only to be crushed by Soviet tanks. A dozen years earlier, in
    October 1956, Hungarians had gone even further, taking up arms against the
    Stalinist régime in Budapest before Moscow re-established control with tanks
    and an iron fist. </p>
  <p>These experiences nourished durable civic myths, that ordinary citizens
    could bend the arc of history and that Moscow’s dominance was neither
    inevitable nor permanent. When communism collapsed in 1989, both societies
    looked westwards, rushing to embed themselves in Euro-Atlantic
    structures-first NATO, then the European Union-believing that liberal
    democracy was the only logical destination. Regression was at no point
    evident. </p>
  <p>Three decades later, that destination suddenly looks less secure. Viktor
    Orbán in Hungary and Robert Fico in Slovakia have embraced a form of
    <em>illiberal </em>politics that challenges Brussels, courts Moscow, and
    curtails domestic checks and balances. It is thus somewhat paradoxical that
    two countries who resisted communism the most, who sought eagerly to join a
    union of liberal nations, have since elected governments seeking the
    complete opposite with ties to the Kremlin. </p>
  <p><strong>Hungary, Orban and the rise of authoritarianism </strong></p>
  <p>Born in 1963 and initially celebrated as a liberal firebrand in the 1990s,
    Viktor Orbán co-founded Fidesz as a youth party demanding Soviet withdrawal.
    By 1998 he had become prime minister, presiding over a broadly centrist
    government. Electoral defeat in 2002 pushed Fidesz into a long spell of
    opposition, during which Orbán began- gradually at first -to recast the
    party as a nationalist, Christian-conservative movement. </p>
  <p>Hungarian and international observers overwhelmingly identify 2014 the year
    of Viktor 1</p>
  <p>Orbáns 26 July address at the Bálványos (Tusnádfürd) Summer University in
    Bile Tunad, Romania was the public ’point of no return’ when he openly
    embraced an illiberal model of government[5]. In that speech Orbán first
    described the Hungarian state he was ’building’ as illiberal, held up
    Russia, Turkey and Singapore as successful examples, and urged a clean break
    with Western liberal norms. </p>
  <p>Since returning to office in 2010 Orbán has rewritten the constitution,
    stacked the Constitutional Court, and turned state and private media into
    reliable cheer-leaders. Polling shows that his core electorate is older,
    rural, and economically insecure; surveys in 2024 listed immigration,
    national sovereignty, and the cost of living as top concerns. These
    anxieties were weaponised during the 2015 refugee crisis, when police used
    tear gas and batons at the Röszke border crossing and vigilantes assaulted
    asylum seekers on camera[11]. </p>
  <p>International watchdogs now classify Hungary as only partly free[6], while
    the European Com mission continues to freeze portions of cohesion and
    recovery fundsabout 20 billion remained suspended as of early 2024[7]. </p>
  <p><strong>Slovakia turns away from Brussels </strong></p>
  <p>Slovakia’s democratic backsliding has begun later but been faster and no
    less dramatic. Robert Fico, first elected premier in 2006, mixed social
    populism with pragmatic Euro Atlanticism. His resignation in 2018, after the
    murder of journalist Ján Kuciak, seemed to close that chapter. Yet voters
    returned him to power in September 2023 at the head of a coalition sceptical
    of sanctions on Russia and openly hostile to independent media. </p>
  <p>Within months the government halted military aid to Ukraine, threatened to
    block Kyiv’s EU accession, and floated the idea of withdrawing from NATO’s
    integrated command. Fico’s high-profile trip to Moscow in December 2024
    symbolised this pivot[12]. Polling by Ipsos in early 2025 showed a split
    electorate: urban voters prioritised rule of law and EU alignment, while
    rural districts in the east emphasised energy prices and cultural
    conservatism[15]. </p>
  <p>The Commission has already warned that fresh rule-of-law proceedings could
    endanger 68 billion in cohesion funds, though 799 million was released in
    late 2024 after limited judicial reforms[14]. </p>
  <p><strong>Rage against the machine: the rise of Hungarian protests </strong>
  </p>
  <p>Street politics never disappeared in Hungary, but they intensified after
    2014. Key milestones include the mass mobilisation against the proposed
    "internet tax"[8], the occupation of public squares to defend the Central
    European University in 2017[9], and nationwide teachers’ strikes beginning
    in 2022[10]. The movement broadened in 2024 when Péter Magyar, a former
    insider, led tens of thousands through central Budapest calling for an end
    to corruption. </p>
  <p>2</p>
  <p><strong>Protests in Slovakia, pre-empting Hungarian authoritar ianism
    </strong></p>
  <p>Pro-EU protest traditions date to February 2018, when 60 000 Slovaks held
    vigils under the banner "For a Decent Slovakia". The current wave erupted on
    23 December 2024 under the slogan "Dos bolo Ruska" (Enough of Russia),
    triggered by Fico’s Moscow visit. Weekly gatherings peaked at roughly 60 000
    in Bratislava’s <em>Námestie Slobody </em>on 24 January 2025[13] and spread
    to 28 municipalities. </p>
  <p>Opposition parties Progressive Slovakia (PS), Christian Democrats (KDH),
    and Freedom and Solidarity (SaS) lend logistical support, but rallies remain
    officially non-partisan. Organisers prioritise EU flags, Ukrainian symbols,
    and references to the 1989 <em>Gentle Revolution</em>. Unlike in Hungary,
    police responses have stayed mostly restrained, though government rhetoric
    paints protesters as foreign agents. </p>
  <p>While Hungarian protests chip away at a decade-old illiberal
    super-structure, Slovak demonstrations aim to prevent one from
    consolidating. The social bases also differ: Hungarian marches skew urban
    and middle-class but increasingly attract rural teachers and health care
    workers; Slovak rallies draw a cross-regional coalition united by
    geopolitical rather than economic grievances. </p>
  <p><strong>The most recent protests </strong></p>
  <p>By late May 2025 momentum in both countries showed signs of fatigue, yet
    neither movement has disappeared, </p>
  <p>• <strong>Hungary </strong>The May 2025 demonstrations against a draft
    "Sovereignty Protection" bill widely likened to Russia's foreign-agent law
    drew an estimated 10 000 participants despite police intimidation[2].
    Civil-society groups such as the Hungarian Helsinki Committee and student
    network ADOM provide organisational backbones, while independent news
    portals like <em>Telex </em>livestream events to a politically polarised
    audience. </p>
  <p>Organisers now plan a 3 km "human chain" encircling Parliament on 1 June
    and have announced weekly vigils until the vote. </p>
  <p>• <strong>Slovakia</strong>-"Slovakia is Europe" rallies on 9 May 2025 drew
    several thousand demonstrators in Bratislava and five other cities,
    protesting Premier Fico’s Moscow visit. </p>
  <p>Street leaders have paused further marches until after the 12 June
    European-Parliament election, aiming to convert past turnouts peaking at an
    estimated 60 000 in January into pro-EU votes. </p>
  <p>This tactical shift from mass rallies to electoral mobilisation will
    determine whether either campaign can still force policy reversals in
    Budapest or Bratislava. </p>
  <p>3</p>
  <p><strong>EU funding, and the veto problem </strong></p>
  <p>The architects of EU enlargement assumed that once inside, member states
    would keep moving towards deeper liberalisation. The treaties therefore made
    entry arduous but offered no workable way to force exit, or even a reliable
    suspension mechanism, for wayward democracies. This weakness is becoming
    ever more prescient. </p>
  <p>In response, conditionality tools introduced after 2020 allow Brussels to
    freeze structural and recovery funds when the rule of law is threatened.
    They have had mixed results: Hungary lost 1 billion permanently in January
    2025, yet 10 billion was released in 2023 after Orbán lifted a veto on the
    50 billion Ukraine Facility. Critics complain that the Commission has
    created a market for vetoes, enabling small states to trade EU
    foreign-policy unanimity for cash. Effectively this has become a very
    effective means of blackmail for a state whose interests have diverged from
    the norm. </p>
  <p>Fico is already signalling that Slovakia might block future sanctions
    against Russia unless cohesion money continues to flow. Such transactional
    bargaining underscores the systemic risk: a handful of illiberal governments
    can paralyse the Union’s external agenda while being shielded from
    expulsion. </p>
  <p>This all comes at a time when Russia is unleashing some of the most intense
    attacks on Kyiv of the war, whilst European support is ever more critical in
    the face of an untrustworthy US government. </p>
  <p><strong>The outlook </strong></p>
  <p>Historical precedent suggests that sustained, broad-based civic
    mobilisation <em>can </em>topple entrenched regimes yet success is far from
    guaranteed. In Hungary, Orbán’s electoral super majority, gerrymandered
    districts, and media dominance impose daunting structural barriers. In
    Slovakia, the ruling coalition is slimmer, but opposition fragmentation and
    information echo-chambers complicate electoral arithmetic. </p>
  <p>Democracy is most prone to crumbling when the electorate finds its loss
    inconceivable, leading to the entrenchment of anti-democratic structures
    that are stubborn to reversal. </p>
  <p>If the protests falter, Brussels will face a profound legitimacy dilemma:
    how to defend its normative core when internal challengers exploit
    institutional loopholes. Conversely, a victory for the protesters would
    revitalise the EU’s transformative narrative and reaffirm 1989’s unfinished
    promise. Either way, the streets of Budapest and Bratislava have become test
    laboratories for the future of European liberal democracy. It cannot be
    understated how destructive these regimes could be for the EU project as a
    whole. </p>
