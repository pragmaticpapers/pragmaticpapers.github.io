    actions were taken in response to concerns raised by the administration,
    including allegations related to antisemitism on campus during Gaza-related
    protests and reports of Harvard providing training to the XCPP, a Chinese
    group under US sanctions. The administration cites national security and
    civil rights protections, but critics say this is a threat to academic
    freedom and tries to frame elite institutions as politically adversarial.
  </p>
  <p>Before taking a side, let’s examine each argument and explore how different
    corners of the media report the issue. The goal is to lower the volume,
    focus on facts, and view the story through a clear lens.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence of Antisemitism at Harvard</strong></p>
  <p>In response to the October 7th Hamas attacks, tensions escalated to
    protests, counter protests and debates on many elite college campuses over
    the treatment of the Palestinians. Claudine Gay faced heavy criticism for
    not adequately condemning the Hamas attacks during a <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2023_United_States_Congress_hearing_on_antisemitism">Congressional
      hearing on antisemitism</a> in December ‘23. This <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/harvard-president-claudine-gay-resigns-841575b89bcdc062cdf979e647a2539e?utm_source=chatgpt.com">eventually
      led to her resignation</a>. In April, <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/27/us/college-protests-police-response.html?searchResultPosition=8">protestors
      set up encampments</a> to call attention to the issue of funds going to
    Israel. The encampment at Harvard lasted three weeks and ended with the
    sides coming to an agreement to remove the encampments with no negotiations
    or concessions from the college administration. While participants were
    immediately threatened with disciplinary action, Harvard was able to avoid
    law enforcement involvement.</p>

  <p>Harvard initially suspended five students, but <a

      course following widespread criticism</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Evidence of Harvard’s work with the XCPP</strong></p>
  <p>On May 19, 2025, the <a
      href="https://selectcommitteeontheccp.house.gov/media/press-releases/lawmakers-demand-answers-harvard-over-ties-chinese-military-sanctioned">Select
      Committee on the CCP</a> sent a letter to Harvard calling for transparency
    and accountability over ethical concerns. They stated Harvard provided
    repeated training to the Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps (XPCC).
    This group was sanctioned by the US in 2019 for it’s role in the CCP’s
    genocide of Uyghur Muslims. The Committee also wanted information on
    research partnerships with universities that are described as having links
    to the Chinese military, collaborating with Iranian-government funded
    researchers and with a People’s Republic of China-based group over organ
    transplant research. <a
      href="https://www.harvard.edu/president/news/2025/supporting-our-international-students-and-scholars/">Harvard
      states they are in compliance with the law</a> and these accusations
    result from their refusal to surrender to the federal government’s illegal
    assertion of control over curriculum, faculty, and student body.</p>
  <p><strong>The government’s response</strong></p>
  <p>The Trump administration cited <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/27/nx-s1-5409576/trump-harvard-lawsuit-funding-international-students">Harvard’s
      failure to curtail antisemitism</a> when it froze $2 billion in research
    grants and revoked its ability to enroll international students. It will
    also work to “aggressively revoke” visas to Chinese students, citing ties to
    the CCP.</p>
  <p><strong>How this is reported in the Media</strong></p>
  <p>Depending on the media you frequent, you may have the story framed in ways
    that evoke certain emotions. Each side employs these methods in ways that
    promote their world view.</p>

  <p>Who’s right? Both are. Who’s wrong? Both are. Each narrative trims the
    facts to fit the fear. The articles reviewed from the Daily Wire mostly
    quotes the members of the Trump administration without adding much context
    or counter views. It also frames foreign students in a negative context. The
    articles in the New York Times look at the legal aspects while pointing out
    perceived contradictions. It also does more to highlight the benefits of
    attracting foreign students. If you are like most people, it’s probably hard
    to see an issue with one side, since it aligns with your perspective. Where
    one person sees a university targeted, another sees the homeland threatened.
    What’s certain is neither is getting the whole story. </p>
  <p>To be clear, this is the system we (the people) reinforce. If people spent
    more time reading neutral, fact based reporting, the market would absolutely
    supply that. The emotional reactions from biased articles are entertaining.
    The partisan portrayal allows us to save the cognitive effort needed to
    examine the information and really come to our own conclusions.</p>
  <p>The problem with this environment is you end up with both sides misreading
    each other. The actual source of the problem gets lost in the fight and as
    emotions flare, heels dig in and everyone stops listening. We aren’t
    identifying actual problems and addressing them procedurally, though the
    courts are trying. We are in a pressure pot and things are getting more
    tense with every yell. </p>
  <p><strong>My (very biased) take</strong></p>
  <p>I have been a nerd my whole life. When I was 4 years old, I used to pretend
    to read chapter books. When my older sister brought home math with letters,
    I couldn't wait until I was old enough to learn what it meant. These people
    whose reflex is to be threatened by knowledge are foreigners to me.</p>
  <p>That instinct — to seek understanding rather than fear it — is what makes
    institutions like Harvard necessary, even when they're flawed. Not because
    they’re always right, but because they’re supposed to be places where we
    work through hard questions instead of papering over them with slogans and
    scapegoats. That’s what makes this moment feel so dangerous. It’s not just a
    policy dispute. It’s the rejection of inquiry itself. This is just revenge,
    disguised as reform.</p>
  <p>Trump prefers being a paper tiger over being a president. He rules by vibes
    and mood swings instead of through the vast institutional empire he can
    direct. Does Harvard collaborate with US sanctioned paramilitary groups? I
    don’t know. I know if they do, I don’t want them to. I also know we have the
    <a href="https://ofac.treasury.gov/">Office of Foreign Assets Control</a>
    (OFAC) to investigate and enforce these sanctions. For all the allegations
    raised by the Select Committee on the CCP, nowhere was there a call for the
    OFAC, the group with the technical knowledge and expertise, to investigate
    Harvard’s dealings with foreign groups. They certainly aren’t releasing any
    evidence to support their accusations.</p>
  <p>Was Harvard fostering an antisemitic environment and putting jewish
    students at risk? I don’t know, but if they were, I want those people
    punished. But protests at Harvard were not unique to Harvard. These events
    happened on many campuses. Harvard managed to keep their protests more
    contained, not involve law enforcement, and settled voluntarily. Sure, they
    backed off suspensions eventually, but they also had a president resign,
    weathered several faculty leaving in protests, were criticised for not
    discipling protesters, then faced backlash for trying to discipline
    protestors, and had a significant decline in donations to the school from
    donors sympathetic to both<a
      href="https://edition.cnn.com/2023/10/19/business/harvard-upenn-donors-israel">
      Israel </a>and <a
      href="https://www.thecrimson.com/article/2024/5/10/alumni-pro-palestine-stop-donations-solidarity/">Palestinian</a>
    causes.</p>
  <p>Now, as the only institution acting as a bulwark against an administration
    high on its own farts and the capitulation of nearly everyone before they
    sent that <a
      href="https://www.harvard.edu/research-funding/wp-content/uploads/sites/16/2025/04/Letter-Sent-to-Harvard-2025-04-11.pdf">letter
      to Dr. Alan Garber</a>, Harvard will now have to deal with its research
    grants being frozen and its foreign students being targeted.</p>
  <p>If there is a better answer here, I'm having trouble finding it. This is
    the fact of these matters though. Doing the right thing, so often, means to
    suffer in the short term. For this to turn around, bad things have to happen
    so people are reminded of why the rules were there in the first place. No
    rewards will be had until the damage is done and future generations can
    hopefully look back with cooler heads and hard lessons learned.</p>
