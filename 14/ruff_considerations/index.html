  <p>As Congress is considering the Big Beautiful Bill on Capitol Hill, they are
    also looking at <a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-budget-doge-npr-pbs-usaid-congress">codifying</a>
    the cuts made by the Department of Government Efficiency, or DOGE,
    spearheaded by Elon Musk until recently. However, the cuts Republicans seek
    to codify are a small portion of DOGE’s total identified cuts: $9 billion
    out of the total claimed savings of $175 billion. To put that into
    perspective, a savings of $9 billion would save just 0.13% of total <a

  <p>The cuts Republicans seek to codify include $8.3 billion in foreign
    assistance, from USAID and the African Development Foundation, and $1.1
    billion in funding for the Corporation of Public Broadcasting. However,
    before examining what these cuts will impact, it’s important to note that
    these funds have already started to be cut off by DOGE. In fact, about 83%
    of USAID’s programs have already been <a
      href="https://foreignpolicy.com/2025/03/10/trump-rubio-usaid-cuts-foreign-aid/">cancelled</a>
    by Trump. Additionally, about $535 million in funding to PBS and NPR has
    started to be cancelled by the executive branch. Subsequently, numerous
    lawsuits have been filed alleging that the President has no authority to cut
    funding from USAID and the CPB because it is funding authorized by Congress
    to an independent agency and a nonprofit corporation.</p>
  <p>To start with, the $8.3 billion in foreign assistance Republicans seek to
    cut includes funding to USAID. USAID spent $21.7 billion in FY2024, so if
    the bulk of the cuts in foreign assistance is from cuts to the agency, the
    Republicans’ plan would cut about 38% from USAID’s budget. About 3 in 5
    foreign assistance dollars are distributed by USAID and the majority of the
    assistance, about <a
      href="https://www.statista.com/chart/17610/countries-receiving-us-foreign-aid/">$16
      billion</a> in FY2023, goes to help Ukraine. Assuming the bulk of the
    savings would come from cutting USAID spending, it seems likely that cutting
    $8.3 billion from the agency would impact the US’ assistance to Ukraine
    while it actively defends itself against Russia. </p>
  <p>In fact, since the dismantling of USAID has already begun, we can see how
    the dismantling of USAID has <a
      href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/how-the-attack-on-usaid-hurts-ukraine">hurt
      Ukraine</a>. For instance, according to the Ukrainian outlet Suspilne,
    dozens of humanitarian projects were paused in Mykolaiv, a Ukrainian city
    regularly attacked by Russia. In the Mykolaiv region, more than 70
    institutions and public organizations were left without USAID support.
    Infrastructure recovery in Khmelnytskyi, where Russia has been attacking
    energy infrastructure, was slowed according to local officials. Many
    Ukrainian media outlets countering Russian misinformation, including
    Ukrainer, have lost funding they received from USAID. However, instead of
    identifying instances where USAID funds were used not to their liking in
    Ukraine, Republicans have identified grants worth at most $1 million to
    initiatives in other countries, grants that are a small portion of USAID’s
    budget. These relatively small grants are what Republicans will use to
    justify the shuttering of America’s soft power throughout the world being
    codified into law.</p>

  <p>Similarly, Republicans have proposed cutting funding to the US African
    Development Foundation, another independent agency. However, unlike USAID,
    the foundation does not cost billions of dollars but instead only costs <a
      href="https://www.usaspending.gov/federal_account/166-0700">$60
      million</a> to invest in African social entrepreneurs and grassroots
    enterprises. The investments by the US African Development Foundation
    primarily address low energy access, unemployment, and food insecurity in
    Africa.</p>
  <p>In addition to the foreign assistance cuts, Republicans seek to codify cuts
    to the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) into law. The Corporation
    of Public Broadcasting primarily allocates their <a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/trump-budget-doge-npr-pbs-usaid-congress">$535
      million</a> in funds to locally owned public television and radio stations
    via PBS and NPR. Trump is reportedly proposing the rescission of $1.1
    billion, two years worth of funding, from the Corporation for Public
    Broadcasting to Congress. If these cuts are codified into law, PBS and NPR
    would either have to raise more money from local communities to make up for
    the difference or cut funding to local stations. This could have a
    devastating impact on our media environment today.</p>

  <p>Overall, the codification of the DOGE cuts that Congress is proposing could
    have devastating impacts on America’s soft power, ceding ground to the US’
    adversaries like China. It would also likely devastate aid to Ukraine and
    locally owned public television/radio stations. Make sure to call your local
    congressperson and senator to give your opinion on these proposed
    devastating cuts.</p>
