  <p><strong>The Pathfinder: How A Trump-Appointee Became The Strongest Defender
      of Tribal Rights in Supreme Court History</strong></p>
  <p>Native American rights groups seem to have found some representation on the
    bench in an originalist Trump-appointee named Neil Gorsuch. </p>

    <span class="caption">The Supreme Court’s relationship with Native American rights is one of the
      most storied parts of the institution’s history. From <a
        href="https://supreme.justia.com/cases/federal/us/21/543/"><em>Johnson v.
          McIntosh</em></a><em> </em>in 1823, which forbade the sale of Tribal
      land to private individuals, effectively establishing the “doctrine of
      discovery;” to <em>Cherokee Nation v. Georgia</em> in 1831 which defined the
      status afforded to Native American tribes in the United States, there is no
      dearth of landmark cases relating to our indigenous counterparts.</span>
  </div>
  <p>Some former and current Justices can be noted for outwardly giving their
    support to the legal rights of Native Americans; notably, Sandra Day
    O’Connor supported the Indian Child Welfare Act and Thurgood Marshall often
    protected tribes from state interference. However, no one, other than the
    Trump-appointed Neil Gorsuch, has made it a hallmark of their judgeship to
    not only defend, but promote and assert the rights of tribes, when they come
    before the Court.</p>
  <p>How did a Trump-appointee, who was considered “too conservative for the
    position” by some, become such a stalwart defender of a traditionally
    liberal cause? How did Justice Gorsuch metaphorically “reach across the
    aisle” and develop a partnership with staunch liberal Justice Sonya
    Sotomayor? The answers reveal a lot about how we view political alignments
    in the Judiciary, the interpretation of government policies by minority
    groups, and the values we all share as Americans.</p>
  <p><strong>Tribal Rights and Gorsuch</strong></p>
  <p>To fully understand how Justice Gorsuch defends Tribal rights in
    Washington, deciphering and analyzing his opinions on certain key rulings
    can certainly help us get there. Of the many cases to choose from, Justice
    Gorsuch’s concurring opinion in <em>Washington State Department of Licensing
      v. Cougar Den, Inc. </em>in 2019, as well the various cases related to
    <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma, </em>can best shine light on his reasoning and
    motivations.</p>
  <p>In 1885, the Yakama Nation signed the Yakama Nation Treaty at the Walla
    Walla Council in present-day Washington State. This treaty ceded around 10
    million acres of traditional Yakama land to the United States federal
    government in return for exclusive rights to members of the tribe; one of
    the rights included was the right to free travel on all public highways. In
    the early 2010s, the Yakama Nation founded a company,Cougar Den, Inc., to
    import gasoline to sell to tribal members on their reservation. The State of
    Washington has a tax on all imported fuel that enters its borders via truck,
    essentially forcing the Yakama Nation to pay taxes for their imported
    gasoline. The Nation refused, the State applied penalties on the
    corporation, and the back-and-forth ensued until the issue reached the
    Supreme Court.</p>
  <p>The Supreme Court ruled in favor of Cougar Den in a 5-4 ruling, with former
    Justice Breyer stating that the inherent aspect of the Yakama Nation Treaty
    was that tribal members must not pay taxes on imported goods. Gorsuch’s
    concurring opinion goes even farther , stating the treaty was articulated to
    members of the tribe (in Chinook) to have had insinuations that the right to
    free travel would not become expunged once a member used public highways for
    commerce. Gorsuch goes even farther, discussing the history of the Yakama
    Nation and how the federal government abused the power dynamics in order to
    get what it wanted. He concludes his opinion with the following:</p>
  <p><em>Really, this case just tells an old and familiar story. The State of
      Washington includes millions of acres that the Yakamas ceded to the United
      States under significant pressure. In return, the government supplied a
      handful of modest promises. The State is now dissatisfied with the
      consequences of one of those promises. It is a new day, and now it wants
      more. But today and to its credit, the Court holds the parties to the
      terms of their deal. It is the least we can do.</em></p>
  <p>Such an opinion is something we would normally see from Justice Kagan or
    Sotomayor. This is not the only such opinion from Gorsuch on Tribal matters;
    look no further than his dissenting opinion in <em>Oklahoma v.
      Castro-Huerta.</em></p>
  <p><em>Oklahoma v. Castro-Huerta </em>is a case that is much too complex to
    fully develop in this piece. One cannot truly understand the scope of this
    case without also understanding <em>McGirt v. Oklahoma </em>and <em>Sharp v.
      Murphy</em>. In a quick summary, these cases relate to Tribes in Eastern
    Oklahoma and how they policed and prosecuted crimes committed on reservation
    territory. While there are numerous tidbits of support for Tribal rights in
    <em>McGirt,</em> Gorsuch’s dissenting opinion shows not only his consistent
    ability to break from the other conservative Justices, but also his lack of
    faith in the Court’s ability to uphold previous treaties and the rights of
    Native Americans. He writes:</p>
  <p><em>Where this Court once stood firm, today it wilts. After the Cherokee’s
      exile to what became Oklahoma, the federal government promised the Tribe
      that it would remain forever free from interference by state authorities.
      Only the Tribe or the federal government could punish crimes by or against
      tribal members on tribal lands. At various points in its history, Oklahoma
      has chafed at this limitation. Now, the State seeks to claim for itself
      the power to try crimes by non-Indians against tribal members within the
      Cherokee Reservation. Where our predecessors refused to participate in one
      State’s unlawful power grab at the expense of the Cherokee, today’s Court
      accedes to another’s. Respectfully, I dissent.</em></p>
  <p>Don’t be fooled, Justice Gorsuch’s breaking away from other judicial
    conservatives on this issue does not show that he is some hidden liberal.
    Gorsuch is openly conservative on LGBT rights, the Second Amendment, and
    abortion. With his position on Tribal Rights established, we should now
    examine how he reached it.</p>
  <p><strong>The Nature of His Stance</strong></p>
  <p>Justice Gorsuch’s legal philosophy is relatively plain. He is an
    originalist, in the same breath as Scalia and Thomas. He is a conservative,
    in the same style as Kavanaugh and Barrett. But he is also a “textualist,”
    and while other former and current members of the Court proclaim themselves
    to be such, it truly feels like Gorsuch is <em>genuinely</em> one.</p>
  <p>Textualism is the belief in interpreting laws based squarely on the meaning
    of the original text when it was passed. Considerations regarding hidden
    intentions, secondary sources, and anything else of the sort are considered
    ultimately “unimportant” to textualists. During his Senate confirmation
    hearings, Gorsuch was asked about his stance on textualism, in which he
    responded by saying:</p>
  <p><em>Textualism offers a known and knowable methodology for judges to
      determine impartially what the law is.</em></p>
  <p>One common argument that can be found in most, if not all, of Gorsuch’s
    work regarding Tribal rights is the inability of the United States to not
    upholding previously signed treaties. Repeatedly, the Supreme Court and
    lower courts were tasked with reading the fine print on documents and
    treaties signed centuries ago. They determine if a treaty that was signed
    with a Tribe is being violated, and if so, what implications that has for
    other interactions between state and tribe.</p>
  <p>With regard to Justice Gorsuch’s textualist approach, one can clearly see
    his adherence to the inherent tenets of the values of this legal philosophy.
    In <em>Washington State Department of Licensing v. Cougar Den, Inc, </em>the
    Yakama Nation Treaty of 1855 was a central point for Gorsuch in why he sided
    with the tribal corporation. In <em>Herrera v. Wyoming</em>, Justice Gorsuch
    upheld the Treaty of Fort Laramie as a reason to side with the Crow Nation
    and their right to hunt on unoccupied lands. Finally, in <em>Ysleta del Sur
      Pueblo v. Texas</em>, Gorsuch brings up both the precedent found in
    <em>California v. Cabazon Band of Mission Indians</em>, as well as the
    Restoration Act.</p>
  <p>Do these examples mean that Justice Gorsuch is “more” of a textualist than
    other Justices who also proclaim themselves as such? I do not know. What
    this does show is that the Justices that sit on the Supreme Court have the
    ability to go across party lines and surprise even the most terminal
    observers. Justices appointed by Republicans do not inherently side against
    Native rights, as the national Republican party does. Legal philosophical
    preferences do not always match up with political philosophical preferences,
    and acting like both must match leads to some very surprising results.</p>
  <p><strong>State of Our Nation</strong></p>
  <p>Justice Neil Gorsuch is a conservative. His voting record is one that shows
    a commitment to the Republican Party and right-wing movements. His judicial
    philosophy stems from the same conservative values that gripped the minds of
    Scalia and Thomas. But his commitment to unabashed textualism, found in his
    opinions ranging from freedom of speech to Tribal rights, shows a side of
    this movement that might still be true. One that recognizes the previous
    attempts at reconciliation by our federal government with the Native
    populations that we subjugated and attempts, at least in part, to right some
    of these wrongs.</p>
  <p>The modern MAGA version of the Republican Party continuously proves
    themselves to be a party that is uncommitted to the Constitution, whether it
    be through attempts to undo birthright citizenship or constantly censure and
    punish speech. One thing we can hope is that the tenets of originalism and
    textualism remain part of the conservative mind, not because they are values
    to uphold within their own right, but because they provide a much needed
    counterbalance to the judicial pragmatism found in more liberal wings of our
    judicial community. Justice Gorsuch, even with all of my disagreements
    regarding his political leanings, shows us that this can be true.</p>
