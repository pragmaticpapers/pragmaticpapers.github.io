  <p><strong>The Illusion of Cool: Unmasking Nayib Bukele’s Authoritarian Rule
      in El Salvador</strong></p>
  <p>Nayib Bukele is not just a president. He is a brand, a performance, a
    meticulously cultivated image projected to the world through Instagram
    filters, viral tweets, and staged displays of power. In an age when
    political charisma often trumps substance, Bukele has mastered the art of
    self-presentation. He calls himself the “world’s coolest dictator,” a phrase
    delivered with a wink that blurs the line between irony and truth. But for
    all the jokes and digital flair, his regime represents something far darker:
    a systematic dismantling of democratic institutions under the guise of
    innovation and progress.</p>
  <p>Bukele’s international persona is that of a millennial disruptor; one who
    takes bold risks, shuns traditional politics, and brings order to a chaotic
    country. He speaks the language of change and modernization, leveraging the
    anxieties of a population long battered by gang violence, corruption, and
    economic stagnation. He’s drawn admiration from crypto enthusiasts, tech
    CEOs, and populists around the world. Yet what many see as courage is often
    coercion. What is framed as visionary leadership is, in reality, the
    consolidation of unchecked power. His government detains tens of thousands
    without trial, surveils journalists, censors critics, rewrites the law to
    suit its needs, and hides public spending behind closed doors.</p>
  <p>What Bukele offers is not a democratic alternative to dysfunction, but an
    authoritarian solution packaged for the digital age. He rules not only
    through policy but through image - carefully curated, deceptively simple,
    and profoundly dangerous. The rest of the world, distracted by hashtags and
    prison drone shots, has been slow to grasp the reality that El Salvador is
    sliding toward autocracy.</p>
  <h3><a id="_r38u1mv14yp5"></a><strong>From Populist Promise to Institutional
      Capture</strong></h3>
  <p>Bukele’s rise to power was built on a potent cocktail of charisma, savvy
    media manipulation, and legitimate public frustration. When he ran for
    president in 2019, El Salvador had spent decades in the grip of a two-party
    system defined by corruption and stagnation. The right-wing ARENA and the
    leftist FMLN, both born from the country’s civil war, had alternated in
    power since the 1990s, and both had lost credibility. High crime, grinding
    poverty, and a sense of hopelessness pushed much of the population to look
    for something new. Bukele provided that alternative, not through a detailed
    policy platform, but by tapping into national exhaustion with the status
    quo.</p>
  <p>As mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán and later San Salvador, Bukele used his
    position to promote an image of youth, innovation, and transparency. He
    posted selfies instead of speeches, ran slick PR campaigns about
    infrastructure projects, and cast himself as a pragmatic problem-solver
    rather than an ideologue. He even paid for the college scholarships of
    students in San Salvador, offering them what he claimed the state was
    keeping from their reach. After being expelled from the FMLN in 2017, he
    doubled down on his outsider narrative, framing himself as someone who had
    been punished for challenging political orthodoxy.</p>
  <p>When he launched his presidential campaign, Bukele leaned heavily on social
    media and digital platforms, bypassing traditional political machines. His
    party, New Ideas, was more of a movement than a political organization, and
    it capitalized on anti-elite sentiment rather than any coherent ideology. He
    ridiculed the press, denounced critics as corrupt, and promised to “drain
    the swamp.” His messaging: simple, emotional, and often combative, resonated
    deeply with a public that felt abandoned by its institutions.</p>
  <p>The strategy worked. Bukele won the presidency with more than 53 percent of
    the vote in the first round; an unprecedented margin that eliminated the
    need for a runoff. It was the first time in modern Salvadoran history that a
    president had been elected from outside the traditional two-party system.
    The moment was hailed as a democratic revolution. In reality, it marked the
    beginning of a new form of centralized power. A power rooted in the
    aesthetics of rebellion but fundamentally hostile to the norms of democratic
    governance.</p>
  <p>What followed was not a reinvention of politics, but a gradual dismantling
    of accountability. Bukele maintained high approval ratings, but he
    increasingly governed by decree, sidelining the legislature and vilifying
    the judiciary when it didn’t bend to his will. His public appearances were
    carefully choreographed, his speeches laced with attacks on enemies real and
    imagined. He styled himself as a savior in a country plagued by chaos,
    suggesting that only through his continued leadership could El Salvador be
    restored.</p>
  <p>In 2021, he leveraged his massive popularity to secure a supermajority in
    the Legislative Assembly through allied parties. That victory was a turning
    point. With total control of the legislative branch, Bukele no longer had to
    negotiate or compromise. On the very day the new Assembly was sworn in, it
    voted to remove five constitutional court judges and the attorney general,
    replacing them with loyalists without even pretending to follow due process.
    The purge was swift, brutal, and illegal, but it was also effective. With
    the judiciary neutralized, Bukele gained the power to reinterpret the law as
    he pleased, setting the stage for his authoritarian turn.</p>
  <p>Critics warned that these moves mirrored the playbook of other autocrats.
    It undermines the rule of law, removes institutional checks, and weaponizes
    public approval against democratic constraints. Bukele scoffed at the
    warnings. In his view, the people had spoken. And with no meaningful
    resistance from within the system, he continued his march toward absolute
    control.</p>
  <p>What began as a populist promise to fix a broken system quickly became an
    excuse to replace it with something far more dangerous: a government in
    which power is concentrated in the hands of a single man, unbound by law and
    unchallenged by institutions.</p>
  <h3><a id="_kamdlhovbjhi"></a><strong>The Security Mirage</strong></h3>
  <p>Central to Bukele’s popularity is his highly publicized war on gangs, which
    he presents as nothing short of a miracle. Once dubbed the murder capital of
    the world, El Salvador has seen a sharp decline in homicides since Bukele
    assumed power, a trend his administration attributes to the state of
    emergency declared in March 2022. The crackdown followed a surge in gang
    killings and gave the government sweeping powers—suspending constitutional
    protections, enabling mass arrests without due process, and criminalizing
    any suspected association with gangs.</p>
  <div class="image-container">

    <span class="caption">Source: <a
      href="https://www.statista.com/statistics/696152/homicide-rate-in-el-salvador/">Statista</a></span>
  </div>
  <p>The campaign has resulted in more than 75,000 arrests in a country of just
    over 6 million. Prisons are overflowing. Due process is the exception, not
    the rule. Individuals have been detained for everything from having tattoos
    to living in gang-controlled neighborhoods. Families search in vain for
    loved ones who disappeared into the state’s opaque detention system. Human
    rights organizations have documented beatings, torture, overcrowding, and
    dozens of custodial deaths, often without any public explanation or
    accountability. Those who do emerge from detention describe psychological
    abuse, starvation, and constant fear.</p>
  <p>To many Salvadorans, the security crackdown feels like long-awaited
    justice. After decades of living under the grip of MS-13 and Barrio 18,
    people welcome the sudden quiet in neighborhoods once ruled by extortion and
    murder. Bukele’s approval ratings remain sky-high, boosted by viral drone
    footage of the newly constructed mega-prison and images of shirtless
    detainees kneeling in submission. But while the optics are powerful, the
    underlying strategy is built on collective punishment and the erosion of
    civil rights.</p>
  <p>This kind of security theater is not new in El Salvador. The country’s
    post-independence history reads like a parade of caudillos and strongmen,
    each promising order in exchange for obedience. Military juntas ruled for
    much of the 20th century, often brutally. The civil war from 1980 to 1992
    was marked by state violence, massacres, and death squads. For generations,
    Salvadorans have been told to choose between chaos and control. Bukele has
    simply modernized the formula: instead of boots and bayonets, he uses
    Twitter and TikTok.</p>
  <p>Beneath the PR campaign lies an uncomfortable truth. Bukele has not
    dismantled the gangs; he has displaced and disappeared their members—some
    guilty, some not—into a system devoid of oversight. And while short-term
    drops in crime are celebrated, the long-term consequences are rarely
    discussed. A society that trades accountability for expediency may find it
    harder to recover from the institutions it destroys than from the violence
    it suppresses.</p>
  <p>In Bukele’s El Salvador, people are no longer asked to pick between safety
    and freedom. That choice has already been made for them. And as history has
    shown time and again, selling liberty for protection is like buying
    insurance from the arsonist—your house may not burn today, but the matchbook
    is still in their hand.</p>
  <h3><a id="_5j0rcepwv8fq"></a><strong>The Charade of the "Cool
      Dictator"</strong></h3>
  <p>Bukele’s most cunning trick has not been his war on gangs or his power
    grabs in the legislature, but his ability to rebrand authoritarianism as
    trendsetting. He has managed to sell the world on the idea that tyranny can
    wear sneakers and a backwards cap, that a dictator who jokes about being a
    dictator isn’t really one. His now infamous Twitter bio, “world’s coolest
    dictator” , is a masterstroke of rhetorical camouflage. The irony cloaks
    intent, allowing him to deflect criticism as outdated, humorless, or simply
    uncool.</p>
  <p>This calculated persona isn’t accidental. Bukele has crafted an image that
    merges the aesthetics of Silicon Valley with the blunt tactics of strongman
    rule. He livestreams cabinet meetings, posts slick edits of his mega-prison,
    and calls out international journalists by name as if engaging in a rap
    battle. His governance is filtered through social media algorithms, where
    policy decisions are teased like product drops and dissent is ratioed into
    irrelevance.</p>
  <p>To many outside observers, especially those tired of traditional
    politicians, this performance is refreshing. Here is a leader who tweets
    like a tech CEO, dresses like a DJ, and speaks with the confidence of a man
    who believes he’s already won the future. But it’s all smoke and mirrors.
    Behind the memes and the millennial branding lies a deeply repressive state.
  </p>
  <p>Independent journalists are harassed, surveilled, and digitally spied on
    using Pegasus spyware; usually a tool reserved for tracking terrorists. The
    media environment has become so hostile that several outlets have relocated
    staff or shut down entirely. Civil society groups are restricted by foreign
    agent laws and risk prosecution if they criticize the regime. NGOs face
    audits, funding freezes, or outright bans. Public institutions no longer
    operate independently; they echo the executive’s messaging, serving as
    amplifiers of a single voice rather than as democratic actors.</p>
  <p>This repression is wrapped in irony and self-awareness, making it harder to
    challenge. When critics accuse Bukele of behaving like a dictator, he
    shrugs, retweets the insult, and turns it into a T-shirt slogan. The satire
    disarms casual observers, creating plausible deniability that shields real
    abuses from scrutiny. In Bukele’s hands, authoritarianism becomes a joke
    that laughs back at you if you take it seriously.</p>
  <p>But there’s nothing cool about crushing dissent. There’s nothing hip about
    weaponizing the state against journalists or locking away thousands without
    trial. Dressing autocracy in designer jackets doesn’t change its
    consequences. Bukele may have rebranded the dictator for the digital age,
    but the fundamentals remain: a regime allergic to opposition, hostile to
    oversight, and obsessed with control.</p>
  <p>Irony doesn’t redeem oppression. It only masks it long enough for people to
    stop noticing when the cage door quietly clicks shut.</p>
  <h3><a id="_e6q0sn2cryj7"></a><strong>Rewriting the Constitution Without
      Amending It</strong></h3>
  <p>After consolidating his grip on the legislature and judiciary, Bukele no
    longer needed to pretend he was governing within the lines. In September
    2021, El Salvador’s Constitutional Chamber (newly packed with his loyalists)
    issued a sudden and controversial ruling: Bukele could legally run for
    re-election in 2024, despite the Constitution’s clear prohibition against
    consecutive presidential terms. It was a legal sleight of hand, but more
    than that, it was a quiet coup against constitutionalism itself.</p>
  <p>Rather than amend the Constitution through the proper channels, Bukele
    simply had the court reinterpret it. No need for a national debate, no
    public referendum, no legislative process. The Constitution didn’t change on
    paper—it was just hollowed out from within, its words stretched until they
    snapped under the weight of convenience. This was not lawmaking; it was
    legal laundering.</p>
  <p>The precedent it set was chilling. If a president can serve again simply
    because his judges say so, what else can be rewritten in silence? What other
    laws can be bent around the desires of one man? The judiciary, once a check
    on executive overreach, has become a mirror, reflecting only Bukele’s will,
    never questioning it. This is not just a breach of democratic norms; it is a
    deliberate erasure of the mechanisms designed to prevent tyranny.</p>
  <div class="image-container">

  </div>
  <p>Bukele and his allies dismissed the criticism, arguing that “the people
    should decide.” But that populist logic undermines the very purpose of
    constitutional limits. The reason democracies enshrine term restrictions is
    to protect against the slow, seductive pull of permanent power. They are
    meant not just to restrain bad leaders, but to discipline good ones. Bukele,
    by discarding this safeguard, has revealed how deeply uninterested he is in
    accountability beyond the ballot box.</p>
  <p>History offers ample warning. Latin America has no shortage of elected
    leaders who slowly morphed into permanent rulers; often through similar
    judicial or constitutional gymnastics. Bukele claims he is merely following
    the will of the people, but so did Chávez, Ortega, and Fujimori. In each
    case, popular support became the excuse for dismantling the very
    institutions that gave democracy meaning.</p>
  <p>Bukele's defenders argue that his continued rule is justified by his
    effectiveness. But democracy is not a reward system for results; it is a
    structure built on rules, limits, and responsibilities. The moment leaders
    are allowed to change the rules because they believe they're doing a good
    job is the moment the rules cease to matter at all.</p>
  <p>El Salvador's Constitution wasn't defeated with tanks or coups. It was
    reinterpreted into irrelevance; quietly, strategically, and with a smile.
  </p>
  <h3><a id="_gwsehh42uv04"></a><strong>The Bitcoin Fantasy and Economic
      Risk</strong></h3>
  <p>In another example of style over substance, Bukele declared Bitcoin legal
    tender in 2021. He portrayed the move as a bold leap into the future, aimed
    at financial inclusion and attracting global investment. But the rollout has
    been riddled with technical problems, low adoption, and allegations of
    corruption. Most Salvadorans continue to use cash or traditional digital
    payments. A significant portion of the population lacks internet access,
    making the promise of decentralized finance irrelevant to daily life.</p>
  <p>While the government refuses to disclose the full scope of its Bitcoin
    holdings, economists warn that public money is being gambled on volatile
    assets without oversight. The International Monetary Fund has raised alarms.
    The country’s debt remains high, and the Bitcoin initiative has done little
    to resolve long-standing economic issues such as unemployment, poor
    infrastructure, and weak social safety nets.</p>
  <p>In reality, the Bitcoin experiment serves more as political theater than
    policy. It is designed to attract international attention and project a
    narrative of innovation. But the actual beneficiaries are foreign crypto
    interests and Bukele’s inner circle, not the people of El Salvador.</p>
  <h3><a id="_7r0iiyf56maa"></a><strong>A Warning, Not a Model</strong></h3>
  <p>Nayib Bukele’s El Salvador is increasingly hailed by some abroad as a
    blueprint for order in an age of chaos. From Silicon Valley investors to
    right-wing influencers, the admiration often hinges on a simple formula:
    clean streets, high approval ratings, and a leader who “gets things done.”
    But beneath that shiny exterior is a deeply compromised system, one that
    prioritizes power over principle, obedience over oversight, and spectacle
    over substance.</p>
  <p>This is not a model for the region, it’s a warning shot.</p>
  <p>Bukele has not solved El Salvador’s problems; he has simply rebranded them.
    Violence hasn’t been eradicated. It has been absorbed into the state
    apparatus. Corruption hasn’t been defeated. It has been centralized.
    Institutions haven’t been rebuilt. They’ve been emptied and repurposed to
    serve one man’s ambitions. What looks like efficiency is often just
    authoritarianism wearing the mask of modernity.</p>
  <p>None of this is new for El Salvador. The country’s history is littered with
    strongmen who promised stability and delivered repression. Bukele is not the
    antidote to that legacy. He is its latest iteration, more stylish perhaps,
    but no less dangerous. The real innovation isn’t in how he governs, but in
    how well he hides it.</p>
  <p>His regime deserves not admiration but scrutiny. The rule of law matters.
    Transparency matters. Civil liberties matter, even, and especially, when
    crime is high or when leaders are popular. To look at El Salvador today and
    see only progress is to miss the cost at which it comes. The prisons may be
    full, but so are the courts with silence. The streets may be calm, but the
    institutions are crumbling.</p>
  <p>This article has scratched the surface of a broader and more troubling
    transformation. Each pillar of Salvadoran democracy: judiciary, press, civil
    society, constitutional limits, has been weakened in the name of a new
    order. In future pieces, we’ll dig deeper into the mechanics behind these
    shifts: the legal tricks, the economic risks, the surveillance
    infrastructure, and the growing list of those silenced or exiled.</p>
  <p>For now, it's enough to say this: what’s being built in El Salvador is not
    a brighter future. It is a polished cage. And the world should stop
    applauding the man holding the keys.</p>
