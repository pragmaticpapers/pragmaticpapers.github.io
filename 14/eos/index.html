  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

      Order 14298 - Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Discussions
      With the People’s Republic of China</a></p>
  <p>Signed: 5/12/2025</p>
  <p>Published: 5/21/2025</p>
  <p>This EO relies on the <a
      href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82">International
      Economic Emergency Powers Act</a> (the “IEEPA”), the <a
      href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&amp;edition=prelim">National
      Emergencies Act</a> (the “NEA”), the <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10384/pdf/COMPS-10384.pdf">Trade
      Act of 1974 § 604</a>, and <a
      href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:3%20section:301%20edition:prelim)">3
      USC 301</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 references <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-07/pdf/2025-06063.pdf">EO
      14257</a> that declared a national emergency regarding trade deficits. In
    this prior EO, the Administration established that any retaliatory tariffs
    enacted by other nations shall warrant modification of the tariffs
    established in that EO. It further references <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-14/pdf/2025-06378.pdf">EO
      14259</a> and <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06462.pdf">EO
      14266</a> in which the Administration raised the ad valorum duty rate for
    imports from China. It then says that based on no explicit facts, that the
    imposed heightened tariffs should be suspended for 90 days.</p>
  <p>Section 2 then states that as of May 14, 2025 tariffs on China shall be
    reduced to 10% and the ad valorum rate to be reduced to 54%. </p>
  <p>Section 3 details the changes that need to be made to the Harmonized Tariff
    Schedule of the United States to accommodate the reduction of the tariff to
    10%.</p>
  <p>Section 4 details the changes that needed to accommodate the reduction of
    the ad valorum duty rate to 54%.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders various executive officials to take the necessary steps to
    accommodate the terms of this EO.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is the result of the publicly one sided negotiation between the
    Administration and China. Since the beginning of this Administration,
    President Trump has been attempting to induce trade negotiations with his
    contrived enemy, China. When no such negotiations materialized, despite
    repeatedly imposing outlandish tariffs, and the recent and mounting impacts
    to the economy, it is clear that the Administration realized it needed to
    reverse course. This EO creates a pause in the extreme tariffs leveled by
    this Administration on China. </p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>As tariffs fall, it will make imports less expensive than they were over
    the last month or so, but are still significantly higher than prior to this
    Administration’s actions. It is unclear if any ongoing trade negotiations
    with China are happening, or if China is even open to such negotiations. It
    is likely that as we approach the end of this 90 day pause we will see more
    rhetoric to try to encourage bribes, concessions, or other actions by China
    to personally enrich the members of this Administration to try and reach a
    trade deal. Such a trade deal will likely be the same or potentially
    slightly worse than the status quo. In the meantime small businesses,
    farmers, and everyday Americans will suffer higher prices and potential
    goods shortages.</p>
