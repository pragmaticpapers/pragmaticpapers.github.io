  <p>At this point, it feels like every week I’m forced to write about “the
    largest missile-drone attack of the war,” because week after week, Russia
    seems hell-bent on proving that escalation, not peace, is their only
    objective. This Sunday, May 25th, was no different. Russia launched another
    record-breaking attack: <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2025/05/25/g-s1-68868/russia-ukraine-drone-missile-attack">367
      missiles and drones</a> struck over 30 cities, killing twelve civilians,
    including three children. Zelenskyy stated, “These were deliberate strikes
    on ordinary cities.” And from the reports, that was again true, another
    Russian wave of attacks across multiple regions, striking apartment
    complexes and random neighborhoods. The timing also felt deliberate: May
    25th was Kyiv Day, a celebration of the capital’s founding in the 5th
    century. Just another thing that stands against the Russian narrative that
    Ukraine is “simply Russian” and another obvious attack not just on the
    Ukrainian people, but on their independence and culture.</p>
  <p><strong>Monday, May 26th:</strong> As if the last 72 hours of escalatory
    bombings weren’t enough, <a
      href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/russia-planning-new-offensives-aiming-end-war-ukraine/story?id=122210506">Ukrainian
      intelligence</a> confirmed reports of a potential new Russian offensive.
    In his evening address, Zelenskyy stated again that there is <em>“no
      indication that they (Russia) are seriously considering peace or
      diplomacy,”</em> and that all evidence points clearly toward escalation,
    not negotiation. Meanwhile, over here in the United States, <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/trump-says-putin-has-gone-absolutely-crazy-considering-more-sanctions-russia-2025-05-26/">Trump</a>
    once again appeared to break from his old pal Putin, commenting specifically
    on the last three days of record-breaking bombings and stating Putin has
    <em>“gone CRAZY.”</em> Of course, it wouldn’t be the art of the deal without
    immediately using the moment to also attack Zelenskyy, claiming
    <em>“everything out of his mouth causes problems.”</em> This, again, is
    Trump’s master plan: attack everyone and isolate ourselves.</p>
  <p><strong>Tuesday, May 27th:</strong> While much of the world focuses on
    drone strikes and failed diplomacy, satellite images released by Greenpeace
    revealed something far more ominous: Russia appears to be preparing to <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/27/world/europe/russia-ukraine-nuclear-zaporizhzhia.html">restart
      the seized Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant</a> and connect it to its own power
    grid. The construction of over 50 miles of new power lines near Mariupol
    suggests Moscow is pushing ahead with its long-term plan to repurpose
    Europe’s largest nuclear facility for its own energy needs. This would mark
    the first time in history that a nation at war seized and redirected another
    country’s nuclear infrastructure. Let that sink in. The plant, still
    dangerously close to the front and lacking key staff and equipment, is in no
    shape to be safely restarted. Yet here we are, three years into the war, and
    Russia is not only holding Ukrainian land but preparing to extract its
    energy while the West tries to figure out how many more red lines need to be
    crossed before they do something meaningful.</p>

  <p><strong>Wednesday, May 28th:</strong> <a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/28/russia-propose-ukraine-peace-talks-istanbul">Russia
      proposed a second round of peace talks</a>, which is, of course, in
    response to Trump’s light pressure in recent days. This is standard for
    them. When the pressure from Trump begins, before it can build into anything
    meaningful, they quickly pretend as if peace is still their main goal. It’s
    so obvious I feel dumb even writing it down here, but seeing as this exact
    thing has played out over the past two weeks, I should document it if
    nothing else. Regardless, the proposed meeting would again be in Istanbul
    and is supposed to take place next week. Hopefully, this time it doesn’t
    devolve immediately into Russia threatening to seize more land, but given
    their current preparation for another offensive, that seems the most likely
    outcome.</p>
  <p><strong>Thursday, May 29th:</strong> In Berlin, <a
      href="https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-merz-announces-long-range-weapons-with-zelenskyy/live-72693164">Zelenskyy
      met with German Chancellor Friedrich Merz</a>, and for the first time, it
    seems Germany is seriously considering crossing a line they’ve long avoided.
    Merz announced plans to help Ukraine develop new weapons <em>without range
      restrictions</em>, a pretty promising shift from earlier red lines under
    Scholz. Zelenskyy once again pushed for Taurus cruise missiles, which have a
    500-kilometer range and could be game-changers for hitting behind Russian
    lines. Merz didn’t outright promise them but called their delivery
    <em>“within the realm of possibility.”</em> The catch? Training and
    deployment would take months, so we will have to wait and see. Still, this
    moment marked Germany’s clearest signal yet that its patience with Russia is
    finally wearing thin. Maybe it's the constant strikes, or maybe it's
    watching the U.S. flounder, but something may have finally shifted in
    Berlin.</p>
  <p><strong>Friday, May 30th: </strong>Surprise, surprise, <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/30/world/europe/ukraine-russia-peace-talks.html">Russia
      still hasn’t delivered their so-called peace memorandum</a>. Ukraine’s
    Foreign Minister Sybiha called them out directly, saying if this next round
    of Istanbul talks is going to mean anything at all, Kyiv needs to see the
    Russian proposal <em>before</em> showing up. Pretty reasonable ask,
    especially considering the last meeting. Instead, Moscow says they’ll only
    reveal their terms at the meeting itself, which Ukraine rightly sees as a
    trap, likely to drop some outlandish “terms” and then spin it as Kyiv
    walking away from peace, which of course will win Trump back over. And in a
    wild twist, <a
      href="https://kyivindependent.com/ukraine-behind-explosions-in-vladivostok-causing-damage-to-russian-military-source-claims/">Ukrainian
      intelligence</a> allegedly hit a Russian marine base near Vladivostok,
    nearly 7,000 kilometers from the front lines near their border with North
    Korea. Moscow insists it was just a propane explosion (classic), reports say
    both personnel and command assets were damaged so regardless, we take those.

  <p><strong>Saturday, May 31st:</strong> <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-keeps-russia-guessing-over-participation-june-2-peace-talks-2025-05-30/">Ukraine
      still hasn’t confirmed whether it’ll even attend Monday’s next round of
      talks in Istanbul</a>, and honestly, I don’t blame them. Zelenskyy made it
    clear: no agenda, no advance proposals, no real prep from Moscow then what’s
    the point why walk into another ambush? Meanwhile, Senator Lindsey Graham
    visited Ukraine and warned that “the game Putin’s been playing is about to
    change,” saying the U.S. Senate will move forward with hard-hitting
    sanctions next week. Trump, on the other hand, downplayed everything, saying
    Putin and Zelenskyy are both being “stubborn”, again the master at work
    playing both sides. At this point, Ukraine wants a ceasefire, even a short
    one, and they’ve offered terms. Russia? Still playing games and is ok losing
    1000’s of men every day. So here we are again, stuck waiting to see if
    Monday’s meeting will be real progress or just another Kremlin PR stunt
    overhyped by their guy in the White House.</p>
  <p><strong>Sunday, June 1st:</strong> (written by T R Ullmann/ReasonRiffs)
    Ukraine’s<em> operation spider’s web</em> is the most destructive blow
    against Russia of the war that has implications far beyond the
    Ukraine-Russia conflict.<br /></p>
  <p>This audacious strike diminishes Russia’s ability to fire both tactical and
    strategic nuclear weapons alike. To quote Russian milblogger Fighterbomber,
    “Nobody believed they could hit Belaya; the strike was unexpected and
    humiliating.”<br /><br />With nearly two years of planning-and overseen by
    president Zelensky himself- Ukraine’s <em>ubermacht</em> struck with not
    only spatial but temporal precision given the talks tomorrow in Istanbul. If
    an agreement were to be signed, one would be left to wonder as to whether
    <em>operation spider’s web </em>was one of the most decisive actions of the
    war.<br /><br />The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) predicts a
    short-term dip in Russia’s ability to fire kh-101/22 cruise-missiles with an
    estimated 23 Tu-95 long range bombers and 12 Tu22m3 bombers badly damaged or
    destroyed with 34% of Russia’s total cruise-missile force destroyed. By some
    estimates the damage is within the range of $3.4-7 bn marking not only the
    single biggest loss for Russia of the war but of any military’s airforce
    since world war II. </p>
  <p>To put this in perspective the Moskva-the ship sunk by Ukraine early in the
    war- cost approximately $1bn. Given Russia has ceased constructing many of
    the aircraft destroyed replacements will take at least ten years to
    replace.<br /><br />WIth the strike being conducted clandestinely by a suite
    of drones in the back of a truck the 4300km distance of the Ukrainian border
    puts the entirety of Russia within Ukraine’s sights. This is an additional
    effectual consequence, Russia’s air defense systems, intelligence gathering,
    and defensive structures will now need to be diluted across the immensity of
    Russia’s landmass. The cost to do so will be staggering, and unlikely to be
    within the remit of Russia’s current capabilities. It would therefore be
    unsurprising if further attacks of a similar nature were not
    conducted.<br /><br />Russia now knows, nowhere is safe from the reaches of
    Ukraine’s ever impressive capabilities.</p>
