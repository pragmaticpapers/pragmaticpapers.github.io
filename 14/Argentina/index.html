  <p> Since he assumed the presidency in 1946, Juan Peron's ideology, known as
    Peronism, has dominated the Argentinian political scene prioritizing state
    control of the economy, social justice reforms, and protection of national
    interests. Since the death of Peron in 1974, his party, the Justicialist
    Party, has rapidly lost its ideological unity. Many leaders strived to take
    the party in different directions, such as former President Carlos Menam,
    who advocated for a neoliberal position in Argentina, prioritizing many
    state owned enterprises and pegging the Peso to the Dollar at 1 to 1.
    Following the 2001 Argentine economic collapse in which the peg collapsed,
    Nestor Kirchner won the election against fellow party member Carlos Menam in
    2003. Kirchner along with his wife Cristina, who was president in her own
    right from 2007 to 2015, cemented Kirchnerism as the ideology of the modern
    Justicialist Party. Kirchnerism is a socially left wing variant of Peronism
    advocating for many of the same economic policies and support for social
    justice. The ideology differs from Peronism’s traditional neutral social
    stances in its Social Liberal outlook. Kirchnerist presidents legalized gay
    marriage and abortion while in power. Since the accession of Nestor in 2003,
    Kirchnerist candidates have held the Presidency for 16 years, from 2003 to
    2015 and again from 2019 to 2023. </p>

      the election. The election was subsequently awarded to Nestor Kirchner. This
      was the launchpad for Kirchnerism to become a national ideology. (“Los peronistas Menem y Kirchner se disputarán la presidencia de Argentina
      en una segunda vuelta”)</span>

  <p> The Justicialist Party has held an uncontested spot at the table in
    Argentina. Since its founding, its role has never seriously faltered as a
    major party. Unlike its contemporary opponents, which fall like dominos.
    While still a party, their historic rival, the Civil Radical Union,
    collapsed as a competent national force following the 2001 economic crash.
    While the Justicialist Party remains a constant, its opponents have always
    changed, oftentimes not lasting more than a single election. Following
    Argentina’s economic crisis stemming from many decades of poor economic
    policy, Inflation reached above 50% year over year since May 2021, reaching
    166% by the time of the election. Those economic difficulties lead to the
    election of Economist and Deputy<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-0"
          id="footnote-ref-0">[1]</a></sup></sup> Javier Milei from the La
    Libertad Avanza coalition, a right wing libertarian coalition, as President.
    The election also found Milei with a very small legislative block and
    needing to rely on other similar parties for support in the Congress. Milei
    was inaugurated on December 10th 2023 for a 4 year term as president of
    Argentina.

  <p>On Sunday, May 18th, the City of Buenos Aires held elections for their city
    legislature. Nominally a special “autonomous district”, it retains most of
    the powers of an official province in all but name. It elects deputies,
    senators and votes in national elections and has a Legislature. On Sunday,
    30 out of 60 seats went up for election across the Autonomous district.
    Sunday’s elections represented the first in the city under the Presidency of
    Javier Milei. The elections, originally scheduled for October, were moved
    forward by mayor Jorge Macri. The Buenos Aires Times described the move as
    an “attempt to hurt his rivals” by splitting the dates of the National and
    Local elections and as an effort to turn the affair into a national event.
    May’s elections are also theorized to be planned as to help solve internal
    disputes within Macri’s Propuesta Republicana party (PRO) regarding its
    cooperation with Javier Milei. </p>

    <span class="caption">(Milenioscuro) The Autonomous city of Buenos Aires as seen in dark green
      serves as capital and home to the Argentine President and Congress. The
      district is home to approximately 3.1 million people or about 20% of the
      Metro Population of Buenos Aires.</span>
  </div>
  <p>Since 2005, The Autonomous City of Buenos Aires (CABA) has acted as a
    stronghold for the center-right Propuesta Republicana. Its current mayor,
    Jorge Macri, is the cousin of the former President Mauricio Macri and has
    served as mayor since December 2023. Since the mid 2000s, the city is known
    for its moderate and technocratic governance style during the mayoralty of
    Mauricio Macri and Horacio Larreta. The Americas Quarterly and Georgetown
    Americas institute describe the latter as putting a “moderate” style of
    government and pragmatic politics over political confrontation. The October
    2023 elections in the city served as an antithesis to the rise of La
    Libertad Avanza. While La Libertad Avanza surged nationally, the voters of
    CABA were the only district in the entire country to not back either Milei
    or his Peronist opponent. Despite being from and representing the Autonomous
    District in the Chamber of Deputies, the city rejected Milei and seemed to
    reaffirm its identity as a bastion for the Propuesta Republicana and for the
    traditional opposition. </p>
  <div class="image-container">

    <span class="caption">(Panizza) Jorge Macri won the Mayoral election in 2023 with 49.7% of the
      vote. He has faced criticism from within the Propuesta Republicana including
      previous mayor Horacio Larreta for policies regarding policing and many
      others.</span>
  </div>
  <p>Since assuming the Office of the President in December 2023, Milei and
    Macri and their respective parties maintained a close relationship. While
    the partnership started amicably, cracks have begun to form between the two
    parties. A potential power-sharing deal was killed and shortly after the
    relationship soured between the two titans of the Argentine Right (Nugent).
    According to the Financial Times, Milei pushed these elections as a chance
    to humiliate Macri and the PRO. Among those who opposed the Alliance from
    the beginning was Horacio Larreta, the former Mayor of Buenos Aires from
    2015 to 2023. In the Sunday elections, Horacio Larreta ran under the newly
    created “Volvamos Buenos Aires” coalition, a coalition of former PRO
    officials and current legislatures as a platform to oppose the current
    party’s position towards Javier Milei. The coalition was also formed in
    opposition to the policies of Mayor Jorge Macri, with Larreta expressing his
    desire to reclaim the mayoral office come 2027. </p>

    <span class="caption">(Lorca) Recent feuds have emerged between Javier Milei and Mauricio Macri
      (left) regarding an alliance between the two parties. The Rio times claims
      “By January 2025, their dialogue had collapsed entirely. The upcoming May 18
      elections for Buenos Aires’ legislature have become the battleground for
      this feud.” (Martinez)</span>
  </div>
  <p>Sunday’s election featured a turnout of just 53%, an usually tiny figure
    considering Argentina's mandatory voting policy (Crucianelli). The results
    failed to produce a clear winner, but they produced a clear loser -
    Propuesta Republicana. From the City’s 2023 elections to Sunday’s, PRO’s
    vote share fell from 49.7% to 15.9%, placing 3rd overall. Milei’s La
    Libertad Avanza scored first place with 30.1% of the vote. Second was the
    Peronist “Es Ahora Buenos Aires” who got 27.3% of the vote. Horacio
    Larreta’s breakaway “Volvamos Buenos Aires” scored 4th place with 8.1% of
    the vote. Larreta’s coalition is described as having seriously hurt PRO in
    the city (Claá) delivering a serious blow to mayor Macri - his successor and
    fellow PRO member.

  </p>
  <p>Following the results, the Milei-Macri feud turned public. Shortly after,
    Milei said “maybe he should understand that his moment has passed” of his
    former ally. Similarly, Macri alleged Milei was “destroying the credibility
    of the Presidency.” Macri also claims that Milei is turning this into a game
    for power saying “When (milei) talked to me about his project, I was
    excited, but it turned into a project for power” (Nugent) Following the
    results, Milei announced LLA will work to form an alliance with PRO in the
    influential and largest Argentine province of Buenos Aires (different from
    the city) whether Macri “liked it or not.” (Lorca) </p>

    <span class="caption">(Domínguez) Patricia Bullrich, the last remaining PRO cabinet member and
      their nominee for president in 2023, announced her departure from Propuesta
      Republicana joining La Libertad Avanza on May 6th. Bullrich has served as
      Minister of Security since December 10th 2023.</span>
  </div>
  <p>The results indicate a movement away from the traditionally established
    parties. Both the Peronists and PRO drew lower vote shares than they did in
    2023. Sunday’s results represent a national trend of the decline of
    traditional anti peronist opposition. If polls are to hold, October’s
    results may be the worst for the traditional anti Peronist parties in
    history. Pressure has been put on voters to pick between Milei’s anti system
    approach or Kirchnerism’s anti Milei approach with both sides consolidating
    each's respective political aisle. The 2025 Buenos Aires legislative
    election served as evidence for the emergence of a contemporary de-facto
    two-party system in Argentina as other parties have simply failed to adapt
    to the changing Argentine political environment. </p>
