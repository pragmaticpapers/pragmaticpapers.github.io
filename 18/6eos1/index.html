  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 talks about how bad the California wildfires were and shits on
    California’s response. It then says that it will empower states by better
    streamlining federal wildfire capabilities.</p>
  <p>Section 2 orders executive officials to consolidate their wildland fire
    programs to achieve a better wildfire prevention program.</p>
  <p>Section 3 orders executive officials to improve wildfire prevention policy
    and technologies within the government.</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders executive officials to rescind regulations that would
    hinder wildfire prevention.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders executive officials to declassify historical satellite
    data regarding wildfire prevention and remove regulations regarding the
    withholding of such data. It also orders the secretary defense to sell
    excess aircraft that could help with wildfire prevention.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is hardly more than its name. It is directed towards wildfire
    prevention but contains little of substance to help it. President Trump,
    during his first term, was quite interested in <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nwL6GWYg34M">wildfire
      prevention</a>, and one of his first official acts during this term was <a
      href="https://www.visaliatimesdelta.com/story/news/local/california/2025/03/08/army-corps-knew-trumps-california-water-release-order-was-a-waste/82055516007/">wasting
      2.2 billion gallons of water and lie about how it would help prevent
      fires</a>. For whatever reason, wildfires are a recurring theme for this
    administration. This EO does little more than ask various secretaries in the
    executive branch to meet and discuss ideas for wildfire prevention. It does
    at the tail end seem to open the door for light pillaging of the US Defense
    Department’s aircraft and aircraft parts.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>It is unlikely that this will result in any real wildfire prevention. These
    agencies already were placing wildfire prevention as a high priority.
    Nothing in this EO opens new channels for prevention, nor removes any
    roadblocks halting it.</p>
