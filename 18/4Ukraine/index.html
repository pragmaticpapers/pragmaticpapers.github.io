  <p>On Sunday, June 22nd, we would again see the region of <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-fighting-10000-russian-troops-kursk-region-ukrainian-commander-says-2025-06-22/">Kursk
      inside of Russia</a> pop back up in headlines as Ukraine’s top Commander,
    Oleksandr Syrskyi<strong>,</strong> confirmed that Ukraine is still actively
    operating in the Kursk region. While this was mostly a headline event a few
    weeks back, Russia had been claiming all Ukrainian forces were eliminated
    and pushed from this Russian region. Many had reported on this being false,
    but Ukrainian officials remained relatively quiet on the topic. According to
    Commander Syrskyi, Ukraine still holds roughly a 90 square kilometer section
    of the region and has reportedly been tying down up to 10,000 Russian
    troops, thus preventing Russian infantry from flowing freely to other fronts
    inside of Ukraine. Many experts assumed the Kursk region would be entirely
    under Russian control by this point, but it seems that with the recent
    attacks on Russian land (such as Operation Spider’s Web), Russia is
    beginning to feel the effects of the war.</p>
  <p>Monday, June 23rd, <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/23/world/europe/ukraine-russia-kyiv-attack.html">President
      Zelenskyy</a> managed to make a surprise visit to the United Kingdom just
    hours after another Russian strike on the capital city of Kyiv. This again
    highlights Russia’s new tactic of slamming drones and missiles into
    residential buildings day after day. This one collapsed a 5-story apartment
    complex, killing 9 and injuring over 30, and is already the second such
    attack this week. King Charles III hosted Zelenskyy at Windsor Palace, and
    Prime Minister Keir Starmer reaffirmed the United Kingdom’s support for
    Ukraine. It was a moment that, even if brief, reminded those of us watching
    what it felt like when the entire Western world stood by Ukraine’s side,
    even if only in part. The growing concern now is the Israel–Iran war,
    Israel’s war on Hamas, the Houthis, and even, briefly, India and Pakistan,
    seems to have sapped global attention for conflict. Even just last week,
    Trump snubbed Zelenskyy at the last minute during the G7 summit, which,
    albeit for a relatively important reason, still leaves one wondering if
    Ukraine is just being forgotten.</p>
  <p>Tuesday, June 24th, <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/24/europe/russian-attacks-ukraine-nato-summit-latam-intl">Russia
      launched one of its most devastating waves of strikes in months</a>,
    killing over 40 civilians in less than 48 hours across Ukraine. The worst of
    it hit Dnipro during daylight hours, when a ballistic missile shattered over
    50 buildings and injured more than 170 people, including dozens of children
    and passengers aboard a nearby train. Kyiv was still reeling from a similar
    strike just the day before, and officials fear this escalation is timed
    deliberately with the NATO summit to remind Western leaders of Moscow’s
    reach. President Zelenskyy, speaking from The Hague, directly linked
    Russia’s capabilities to its growing ties with Iran, stating that nearly
    29,000 Shahed drones have been used against Ukraine, 2,700 of them just this
    month. And while NATO officials offered firm words of solidarity, Zelenskyy
    made clear that Russia has rejected every peace deal so far, warning, “Maybe
    [Putin] connects his own political survival with his ability to keep
    killing, so long as he kills, he lives.”</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, June 25th, <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/zelenskiy-hails-substantive-meeting-with-trump-2025-06-25/">President
      Zelenskyy finally managed to get the meeting with Donald Trump</a> after
    the missed opportunity from the week prior. The 50-minute session was
    described by both leaders as “substantive,” with Trump even signaling, for
    the first time, that he may be open to supplying additional Patriot missile
    systems to Ukraine, or at the very least allowing Ukraine the ability to
    purchase them directly. Trump emphasized publicly that these systems were in
    short supply, as the United States had been directing them to Israel in
    recent weeks in response to intensified Iranian missile attacks. Zelenskyy
    took the opportunity to reiterate Ukraine’s willingness to buy them outright
    and even floated the idea of joint production for drones and weapon systems.
    For many, this side of Trump came as a surprise. His brief exchange with a
    Ukrainian refugee now working as a reporter seemed to reveal a side of him
    we hadn’t seen, one that showed, if nothing else, a slight favor for
    Ukraine, which was refreshing, even if small. Still, with the escalating
    conflict between Israel and Iran dominating headlines, it was clear much of
    Trump’s focus remained elsewhere.</p>
  <p>Thursday, June 26th, President Zelenskyy signed a formal agreement with
    the<a href="https://p.dw.com/p/4wTrv"> Council of Europe</a> to create a
    special tribunal that will attempt to prosecute Russia’s top leadership for
    the crime of aggression. While the ICC has already issued arrest warrants
    for Putin and others, it lacks the authority to go after them for starting
    the war itself; this new court fills that gap. Zelenskyy made it clear the
    tribunal’s goal is to show that war crimes and imperial ambitions have
    consequences, stating, “Every war criminal must know there will be justice.”
    Whether Putin ever actually faces that justice remains to be seen, but this
    step feels like one of the few moves left that carries both symbolic and
    legal weight. And while I doubt we’ll ever see Putin on trial, this could
    help snag the ones who flee Russia if and when the economy finally
    collapses.</p>

  <p>Friday, June 27th, Hungarian <a
      href="https://www.dw.com/en/orban-to-continue-anti-ukrainian-course-after-referendum/a-73063866">Prime
      Minister Viktor Orbán</a> used the results of a nonbinding referendum, <a
      href="https://kyivindependent.com/hungary-ukraine-eu-referendum-06-2025/">Vote 2025</a>,
    as justification to continue his hardline stance against Ukraine’s EU
    accession. The entire process, seen by many, including opposition leader
    Péter Magyar, as a scam, was marred by doubts over legitimacy, with Magyar
    challenging the proclaimed turnout of 2.28 million and suggesting the real
    number may have been closer to 600,000. For months, anti-Ukraine propaganda
    had flooded Hungary, portraying Ukrainians as criminals, organ traffickers,
    and a threat to Hungarian livelihoods. And while Orbán has long been one of
    Putin’s most loyal sympathizers in the West, this “Vote 2025” campaign
    marked a shift from merely nationalistic isolationism to something far more
    openly hostile. Even President Zelenskyy, who typically stays composed when
    dealing with figures like Orbán, broke his silence, calling the campaign a
    “serious, historic mistake” and warning that such rhetoric not only
    radicalizes Hungarian society but hands Putin a victory without firing a
    shot.</p>
  <p>Saturday, June 28th, Ukraine’s eastern front once again became the focal
    point of Russia’s slow-burning offensive. <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/top-ukrainian-commander-sees-new-assault-key-eastern-city-2025-06-28/">General
      Oleksandr Syrskyi</a> reported that the region around Kostiantynivka was
    under heavy assault, calling it a renewed effort by Russian forces to push
    into one of the last major cities in Donetsk still under Ukrainian control.
    Fighting has intensified along three directions, though Syrskyi claimed
    Russia had achieved “nothing” except suffering mounting losses. The nearby
    city of Pokrovsk was also mentioned as part of the Kremlin’s strategic
    ambition to grind through the east, meter by meter. Meanwhile, Russia’s
    Ministry of Defense claimed minor gains farther southwest, in the village of
    Chervona Zirka near the Dnipropetrovsk border, but Ukrainian officials
    pushed back on this. Regardless, the Russians seem content with spending
    thousands of their lives for mere meters of land, a strategy that will
    eventually be their ruin.</p>
