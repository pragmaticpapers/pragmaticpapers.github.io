  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

      Order 14309 - Implementing the General Terms of the United States of
      America-United Kingdom Economic Prosperity Deal</a></p>
  <p>This EO relies on the <a
      href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82">International
      Economic Emergency Powers Act</a> (the “IEEPA”), the <a
      href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&amp;edition=prelim">National
      Emergencies Act</a> (the “NEA”), the <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10384/pdf/COMPS-10384.pdf">Trade
      Act of 1974 § 604</a>, and <a
      href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:3%20section:301%20edition:prelim)">3
      USC 301</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 gives a very euphemistic description of the General Terms for the
    United States and the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland
    Economic Prosperity Deal (“GTUSUKGBNIEPD”). It points out specific terms
    regarding automobiles, steel &amp; aluminum, and pharmaceuticals. </p>
  <p>Section 2 establishes a tariff-rate quota of 100,000 automobiles. The first
    100,000 automobiles imported are not subject to the 25% automobile tariff.
    Instead they are subject to a 10% tariff.</p>
  <p>Section 3 gives immunity to the UK for specific tariffs regarding the
    aerospace industry.</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders the adjustment of steel and aluminum tariffs with relation
    to imports from the UK.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO attempts to provide some, though not complete, relief from this
    Administration’s disastrous tariff scheme. However, an EO is not a trade
    deal, nor constitutes a treaty that would govern trade. <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15ng4g5g0eo">As many have pointed
      out</a>, even with the terms stated in this EO, it does not clarify much
    of the trade partnership between the US and America. More likely this EO,
    and much of the news around it, is merely the Administration trying so
    desperately to maintain their brand of “deal making” while having yet to
    deliver a single deal in their first six months.</p>

  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>Critique aside, there is likely a more comprehensive trade deal in the
    works between the US and the UK. This EO, premature as it is, may provide
    some starting points for this negotiation, though such a contribution is
    negligible at best. As mentioned above, this is going to feature prominently
    as some kind of badge of negotiating skill, when in reality it is rather
    embarrassing that it has taken as long as it has for this administration to
    figure out how to trade with one of our oldest trading partners.</p>
  <p><a
      href="http://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-06-24/pdf/2025-11682.pdf">Executive
      Order 14310 - Further Extending the TikTok Enforcement Delay</a></p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 simply extends the the Tik Tok ban for another 90 days. It gives
    no explanation for this extension.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>There is little meaning that cannot be found by a facial reading of this
    EO.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>While this EO is simple in substance it is one of many glaring red flags as
    to the compromised nature of this Administration. There is nothing in the
    law that supports this extension, as the SCOTUS and Congress both have
    approved the ban. There is no explanation other than the pursuit of personal
    gain to Donald Trump for this EO, and it is a stain on the nation and our
    legal system.</p>
