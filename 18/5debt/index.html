  <p>Debt Brakes and Austerity: When Fiscal Rules Ignore Returns</p>
  <p>Thomas R. Ullmann</p>

  <p><strong>Abstract</strong></p>
  <p>For two decades the public–debt–to–GDP ratio has dominated fiscal debate.
    While an ever-rising debt stock can threaten solvency, Germany and the
    United Kingdom show that "fixing the debt" through rigid debt brakes or
    sweeping spending cuts can hobble long-run growth thus counter intuitively
    increase the debt-to-GDP ratio. This article tracks the origins and
    macroeconomic fallout of Germany’s constitutional <em>Schuldenbremse</em>
    and the United Kingdom’s post-2010 austerity programme closing with an
    outline of a return-on-investment (ROI) golden rule 2.0, inspired by the
    Swedish model, that aligns borrowing with long-run prosperity in the air of
    a Keynesian approach.</p><a id="bookmark=id.tv7ve6f14tuu"></a>
  <h1>The Debt Obsession</h1>
  <p>Since the 1980s the median advanced economy has seen gross public debt
    climb from roughly 40% to above 100% of GDP. Each crisis,Latin America in
    the 1980s, the euro debt crisis in 2010, the pandemic in 2020, triggered
    fresh warnings of an imminent debt spiral. Politicians and tabloids
    routinely liken the state to a household that must "tighten its belt" when
    its credit card bill grows. The usual desperate reaction is to look at
    cutting investment in order to reduce short-term borrowing.</p>
  <p>However nations are not households. They outlive any individual lender,
    issue safe assets demanded by the private sector, and most critically have
    policy levers that influence national income, the very denominator of the
    debt ratio. Advanced economies typically borrow in their own currency,
    giving them greater flexibility over debt management and monetary policy
    (though this aspect is more complex in currency unions like the eurozone). A
    government that cuts growth-enhancing spending to hit an arbitrary deficit
    ceiling may end up with a higher debt ratio because GDP shrinks, thus tax
    revenues and/or crime rates push up the cost of policing from under-skilled
    impoverished neighbourhoods.</p>
  <p>Fiscal discipline is necessary, but the right metric is required in order
    for it not to be self defeating. Debt-to-GDP is one such metric that leads
    to economic folly. An alternative return on investment (ROI) method will be
    outlined in this article.</p>
  <p>The German and UK cases provide a cautionary tale against rules that ignore
    the quality of spending and the long-run return on public capital.</p><a

  <h1>Germany’s <em>Schuldenbremse</em> (Debt Brake)</h1><a
    id="bookmark=id.11sb50yii0pp"></a>
  <h2>Origins</h2>
  <p>The 2009 debt-brake amendment, passed in the wake of the global financial
    crisis, capped the Federal structural deficit at 0.35% of GDP and required
    individual Länder (states in US English) to balance their budgets
    entirely[1]. Proponents argued that hard constitutional limits would anchor
    expectations, prevent a repeat of 1990s deficit overruns, and protect future
    generations from "debt mountains". Escape clauses exist for natural
    disasters and severe recessions, but claw-back rules force rapid
    consolidation once the emergency ends.</p>
  <p>This amendment ensured that its reversal would require a two-thirds
    majority vote to reverse. In a country of coalition governments this would
    prove immensely difficult to reverse, even when evidently harmful.</p><a
    id="bookmark=id.k6lvew551cdz"></a>
  <h2>The Investment Gap and Growth Drag</h2>
  <p>Between 2010 and 2019 gross public investment averaged 2.0% of GDP, roughly
    one-third below the OECD mean. The <em>Kommunalpanel</em> reports a
    maintenance backlog of €450 billion, equivalent to the annual economic
    output of the Netherlands. Econometric work by the Kiel Institute suggests
    that every additional one-percentage-point of public-investment-to-GDP lifts
    potential output by 0.6% after three years and 1.0% after ten[2]. By 2024
    the IMF estimated Germany’s potential output to be about 1% below a
    counterfactual without the brake—a permanent hit of roughly €40 billion per
    year in lost income and tax revenue.</p><a
    id="bookmark=id.wk1t1a9r9y2o"></a>
  <h2>Infrastructure and Social Costs</h2>
  <p>Some ’concrete’ examples illustrate both the physical and economic damage,
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Transport</strong> In September 2024, Dresden’s Carola Bridge
      partially collapsed just minutes after a tram had crossed, severing a key
      Elbe crossing and disrupting tram lines, district heating, and river
      navigation. Emergency demolition took 47 hours, but the full replacement
      is not expected before 2030. Initial cleanup alone cost up to €7 million,
      with the total financial burden projected to reach several hundred million
      euros[3]. Nationwide, Germany faces a bridge maintenance crisis: as of
      2023, around 8,000 motorway bridges and 3,000 other long-distance road
      bridges require renovation, while approximately 50% of the 60,000
      municipal bridges are in poor condition[3]. The federal audit office warns
      that current renovation efforts are falling short, with only 69 of 280
      planned bridge projects completed in 2024, and estimates that €2.1 billion
      will be needed for 2026 renovations alone given the state the bridges have
      been left in. Improved upkeep could have reduced overall expenditure
      long-term.</li>
    <li><strong>Digital communications</strong> Only 15% of German households
      had fibre connections in 2023, ranking 34th out of 38 OECD members[4].
      Firms report broadband bottlenecks as the second-largest barrier to
      scaling AI applications.</li>
    <li><strong>Energy</strong> Grid expansion has averaged 450 km per year, far
      below the 1,400 km required to hit the 2030 renewables target. Delays
      already add an estimated €4 billion per year in redispatch costs
      ultimately borne by households[5].</li>
    <li><strong>Law enforcement</strong> A decade of staff and training cuts
      saved the Länder barely €1 billion a year, yet the knock-on jump in
      violent-crime losses and overtime now costs about €4 billion
      annually—turning the headline “savings” into a net fiscal loss[3].</li>
    <li><strong>Military readiness</strong> Skimming defence below NATO’s 2 %
      goal saved roughly €15 billion per year through the 2010s, but today
      Berlin must cover a €100 billion special fund for urgent kit and a €67
      billion base-repair backlog— these initial funds will require substantial
      top ups obliterating earlier savings[6].</li>
  </ul>
  <p>The debt brake was supposed to protect the young from a legacy of debt; it
    now risks saddling them with a legacy of crumbling assets and lower real
    wages. Moreover, the drag of economic growth hits the state’s tax receipts
    either lowering investment or putting further pressure on future governments
    to borrow, contrary to intentions the debt-to-GDP zealots had in the first
    place.</p><a id="bookmark=id.kbfgb7vd3po3"></a>

  <p><em>Germany – cumulative municipal investment backlog, 2000–2024. The
      dotted marker (2009) highlights the introduction of the constitutional
      debt brake. After a decade of near-flat backlog, deferred maintenance
      accelerated sharply—trebling between 2016 and 2024 and reaching roughly
      €450 billion, equivalent to the annual output of the Netherlands.[7]</em>
  </p><a id="bookmark=id.orb521kkwgkt"></a>
  <h1>Austerity in the United Kingdom</h1><a id="bookmark=id.6lqjahp8b8e9"></a>
  <h2>The Deficit-Reduction Programme, 2010–2019</h2>
  <p><em>“I want this Government to carry out Britain’s unavoidable
      deficit-reduction plan in a way that tries to strengthen and unite our
      country… Today, our national debt stands at £770 billion and within five
      years it is set to reach £1.4 trillion… The interest alone could be around
      £70 billion a year.”</em>-Prime minister David Cameron, 2010</p>
  <p>Faced with a post-crisis deficit above 10% of GDP, the 2010 coalition
    government pledged to "balance the current budget" within five years. The
    Treasury mapped out discretionary cuts worth 7.9% of GDP, four-fifths on the
    spending side[8]. Local government grants fell 26%, capital spending dipped
    30% in real terms, and welfare reforms shaved 1.5% off household disposable
    income for the bottom quintile.</p><a id="bookmark=id.lz2sd0xkhjzx"></a>
  <h2>Hidden Costs: Crime, Health, and Human Capital</h2>
  <p>In a similar vein to Germany, British Austerity has stunted the economy and
    destabilised society in a way immensely difficult to reverse. Just a few
    examples include,</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Public safety</strong> Police numbers dropped by 20,000. A panel
      study by Machin (2020) attributes one-third of the subsequent rise in
      violent crime to reduced force size, imposing external costs of roughly
      £4 billion per year.</li>
    <li><strong>Health</strong> NHS spending grew at only half its historic
      rate. Under-investment is linked to 130 000 excess deaths (2012–2019) and
      record waiting lists[9]. Ill health and sickness absence already drain
      about £100 billion a year in lost productivity and benefits—far more than
      the roughly £10 billion a year saved by squeezing the NHS, turning a
      short-term saving into a long-term economic loss.</li>
    <li><strong>Infrastructure and social care shortfalls</strong> In England,
      the National Audit Office warned in 2023 that <em>almost 7 000 school
        buildings require major rebuilding or refurbishment, with some at risk
        of sudden structural failure.</em> [10] Local-government insolvencies
      have become routine: Woking (2023) and Birmingham (2024) both issued
      section 114 notices after debt-fuelled property bets soured.[11], [12]
      Meanwhile the King’s Fund estimates that real-terms spending on adult
      social care fell 12 % between 2010 and 2019, contributing to a record 165
      000 staff vacancies and spill-over delays in the NHS.[13] Each example
      shows how headline "savings" create downstream liabilities that eclipse
      the original cuts.</li>
    <li><strong>Macro impact</strong> The Office for Budget Responsibility
      judges that austerity reduced the level of GDP by 2.5% by 2018—a
      cumulative loss of £350 billion[14]. Ironically, debt/GDP in 2019 was
      still higher than projected in 2010 because slower growth offset deficit
      gains.</li>
  </ul>

      evidenced by the slow down in the growth of debt/GDP. </em></p><a

  <p><em>While the UK pursued austerity after 2010, stimulus-oriented countries
      like the US, Canada, and Sweden experienced stronger cumulative GDP growth
      from 2008 to 2025 thus supporting the argument that austerity may have
      constrained long-term recovery. [15]</em></p><a
    id="bookmark=id.3qb4pnihnp3l"></a>
  <h1>A Smarter Metric: The Golden Rule 2.0</h1>
  <p>The original <em>Golden Rule</em> of public finance refers to a fiscal
    principle that distinguishes between current (consumption) spending and
    investment (capital) spending. It was most prominently used by the UK
    Treasury in the late 1990s and early 2000s, under Chancellor Gordon
    Brown.[16] The original incarnation of the golden rule was focused on the
    use of debt only in investment and not to fund current spending.</p>
  <p>Instead of limiting government borrowing by an arbitrary debt/GDP ratio or
    reducing the deficit by an arbitrary amount a more meaningful approach is to
    consider a return on investment (ROI) methodology that underpins the golden
    rule 2.0.</p>
  <p>This can be laid out making a number of assumptions on potential inflation
    rates alongside spending saved from, for example, increased GDP leading to
    increased tax revenue or reduced crime rate from initiatives engaging
    communities.</p>
  <p>The assumptions made here are for simplicity. With a decent grasp on
    forecasting, variance could be calculated in order to understand the risk of
    the investment.</p>
  <p>Additionally, a return on investment will often be time delayed, say from
    construction times, or from educational projects feeding into a more skilled
    workforce.</p>
  <p>Ultimately the fundamental tenet of the golden rule 2.0 is a positive ROI
    though depending on the project a higher lower bound may be sought .</p><a

  <h2>A general ROI Framework</h2>
  <p>In this section a concise layout of the methodology is given. It will forgo
    descriptions of risk analysis and ignore the details over the change in
    spending saved , and extra tax revenues which themselves will be functions

    id="bookmark=id.kslkwhdx2bfh"></a>
  <h2>Break-even window</h2>
  <p>The year in which a project’s cumulative net benefit turns positive
    (“break-even”) is crucial for fiscal sustainability and political
    feasibility. Projects that repay society within one or two electoral cycles
    tend to face lower appropriation risk and enjoy stronger public support,
    while those with very long payback horizons require robust justification
    (inter-generational equity, climate resilience, etc.) and careful
    discount-rate treatment [17], [18], [19], [20].</p>
  <p>These break-even windows will restrict the expected ROI for a project.
    Examples of how this affects the lower bound of ROI will be given in the
    following section.</p><a id="bookmark=id.hyh4xtkj0on3"></a>

  <h2>Policy Implications</h2>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>Golden Rule 2.0.</strong> Capital projects are approved only
      when the real-term ROI is positive, above the ROI given by the break-even
      window, and within a defined margin of error; day-to-day outlays must
      still be financed from current revenue. Similar notions are discussed in
      the UK’s treasury’s text yet rarely followed. [17], [25].</li>
    <li>The “ring-fenced investment corridor used in Sweden’s fiscal framework
      [26] is the closest model to the golden rule 2.0.</li>
    <li>Additionally costs, including the cost of borrowing, must take into
      account other projects running in parallel, as well as their risks.</li>
    <li><strong>Independent audit.</strong> A non-partisan fiscal council
      certifies key parameters and publishes stress-tests under higher-rate or
      lower-benefit scenarios.</li>
    <li><strong>Ex-post learning.</strong> Five-year look-back studies compare
      realised versus forecast ROI, updating appraisal rules (similar to what is
      practiced by the UK National Audit Office and the Netherlands CPB) [27],
      [28].</li>
    <li><strong>Break-even horizon discipline.</strong> Except for
      climate-adaptation and early-childhood programmes, projects with a
      discounted break-even point beyond 15 years trigger an automatic
      “justify-or-defer” review [21]. This will decide the lower bound for ROI.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Transparency dashboard.</strong> All certified ROI models and
      post-completion reviews are published in machine-readable form; Germany’s
      new <em>Infrastrukturatlas</em> offers a workable template [29].</li>
  </ul><a id="bookmark=id.y2t09c3t594l"></a>
  <h1>Illustrative case study, a high-speed rail link</h1>
  <p>The following is a simplified example based on real world numbers on how a
    project may be assessed for viability assuming it was paid for through
    borrowing.</p>
  <p><strong>Loan terms</strong> Nominal rate ; horizon years; annual repayment
  </p>
  <p><strong>Economic impact</strong> Real GDP rises permanently by 0.2 %, worth
    €8 billion per year in 2025 prices. With a 40 % tax share, billion.
    Road-wear savings add billion, for a constant real benefit of €3.6 billion
    from year 3 onwards.</p>
  <p><strong>Discounting assumptions</strong> Expected inflation ; real social
    discount .</p>
  <p><em>Real present value of costs/benefits,</em></p>
  <p><em>Return on investment,</em></p>

  <p><em>An illustration of the above example when different values of are used
      to reduce or increase the ROI and the effects on the break-even point.
      Even in the case of an ROI=0.5 the break even point is 25 years. Shaded
      regions indicate ±1 standard deviation assuming 5–10% uncertainty in
      estimated costs and benefits, in line with public project forecasting
      guidelines [25]. If the project is delayed by years this will delay the
      break-even window by the same number.</em></p><a
    id="bookmark=id.dzl8gruwuunh"></a>
  <h4>Inflation sensitivity</h4>
  <p>If inflation were 0.5 percentage points higher () while the nominal loan
    rate stayed at 3 %, the real cost of the fixed repayments falls slightly and
  </p>
  <p>underlining that the rule naturally permits more borrowing when real
    borrowing costs are low.</p><a id="bookmark=id.zevabxedrf33"></a>
  <h1>Are any countries doing this already?</h1>
  <p>The closest real-world analogue to the framework proposed here is Sweden’s
    dual fiscal rule. Since the mid-1990s the Swedish parliament has combined an
    overall surplus target with an "investment rule" that permits additional
    borrowing for projects judged to raise long-term productivity [26]. An
    independent Fiscal Policy Council publishes retrospective evaluations and
    the parliament receives an annual investment envelope, so the idea of
    separating capital from current spending is well established. Even so,
    Swedish practice still relies on political negotiation to fix the size of
    that envelope and does not apply a hard, project-level return-on-investment
    (ROI) hurdle at the approval stage.</p>
  <p>Other countries pursue pragmatic variants of the same logic without formal
    ROI gates. Japan has sustained a gross debt ratio above 250 % of GDP for
    more than a decade, pairing large-scale public-works programmes with
    aggressive monetary easing to keep service costs low [30]. Canada operates
    an informal “debt-service-ratio’’ ceiling that caps interest outlays at
    roughly ten per cent of revenues yet still finances an ambitious
    green-transition portfolio [31]. The United States crossed 120 % of GDP in
    2020, but the Infrastructure Investment and Jobs Act (2021) and the CHIPS
    and Science Act (2022) channel new borrowing into productivity-enhancing
    assets, with impact analyses carried out by federal agencies rather than by
    an independent fiscal council [32].</p>
  <p>Sweden therefore demonstrates that separating investment borrowing from
    day-to-day budgeting is politically and administratively feasible, while
    Japan, Canada and the United States show that markets will tolerate high
    headline debt if investors believe the spending lifts future growth.</p>
  <p>What sets the Golden Rule 2.0 apart is the requirement that every project
    clear a quantified, real-terms ROI test before any debt is issued, that the
    aggregate borrowing limit is automatically equal to the present-value cost
    of all certified projects, and that five-year look-back studies feed
    realised data into the next appraisal cycle. By tying borrowing capacity
    directly to forecast earnings and by publishing all models and stress tests,
    the corridor turns today’s patchwork of discretionary judgement into a
    self-adjusting, transparent, and ultimately more credible fiscal discipline
    mechanism. Fiscal discipline should not be about debt avoidance.</p><a
    id="bookmark=id.1zf7vqprek3b"></a>
  <h1>Bottom line: Return on investment driven fiscal discipline</h1>
  <p>Both Germany and the United Kingdom pursued fiscal virtue by focusing
    solely on reducing deficit spending. A debt brake that crowds out investment
    and an austerity drive that slashes productive capacity share the same flaw:
    they treat all borrowing as if it were consumption. These countries are
    illustrative, but they are not alone in leaving economic potential
    unfulfilled through debt avoidance.</p>
  <p>Instead, a smarter framework distinguishes between debt that finances
    future growth and debt that merely shifts today’s bill to tomorrow. By
    embedding ROI logic into fiscal rules, governments can preserve discipline
    while still investing in the assets, physical, human, and digital, that
    underpin long-run prosperity and stability.</p>
  <p><strong>This is not a call to fiscal recklessness.</strong> An ROI approach
    does <em>not</em> sanction infinite spending; it endorses a form of smart
    Keynesianism. Rate shocks, project overruns, and macro-volatility must be
    priced in <em>ex ante</em>, and only investments that clear a risk-adjusted
    hurdle should proceed. Mismanaged projects can still trigger debt spirals:
    poorly spent borrowing drives up financing costs while yielding little in
    return. That is why this methodology bears fruit only when investments are
    rigorously audited and informed by ex-post learning.</p>
  <p>Yet the evidence shows that the <em>greater</em> hazard often lies in
    paralysis, refusing to borrow for projects whose social return is clear.
    Under-investment depresses growth, erodes the tax base, and, by an ugly
    irony, forces future governments to shoulder a larger debt burden to cover
    the revenue shortfall.</p>
  <p>Sound public finance therefore demands neither blanket austerity nor
    open-ended borrowing, but a willingness to invest where yields outweigh the
    costs.</p><a id="bookmark=id.dsor055ngcn1"></a><a
