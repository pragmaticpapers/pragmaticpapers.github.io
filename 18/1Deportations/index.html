  <p>On May 21st, in a rapidly convened hearing, Judge Murphy of the U.S.
    District Court for Massachusetts <a
      href="https://bsky.app/profile/qjurecic.bsky.social/post/3lpp2djssp227">said</a>
    that “The department’s actions in this case [were] unquestionably violative
    of [the] court’s order.”</p>
  <p>Days before this hearing, a plane with eight men had taken off from the
    United States, according to a <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/live/p2U8Eh1VFKI">press conference</a> held
    by the Department of Homeland Security. Only one of these men were from
    South Sudan, as the rest are <a
      href="https://theconversation.com/supreme-court-rules-trump-can-rapidly-deport-immigrants-to-libya-south-sudan-and-other-countries-they-arent-from-258155">from</a>
    Cuba, Mexico, Myanmar, Laos, and Vietnam. However, the DHS decided to fly
    them to South Sudan anyways. The issue was that Judge Murphy had already <a
      href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282404/gov.uscourts.mad.282404.34.0_2.pdf">issued</a>
    a temporary restraining order to stop the Trump administration from removing
    “any individual subject to a final order of removal,” to “a country other
    than the country designated for removal in … prior immigration proceedings”
    without providing them with written notice of the country in question and a
    “meaningful opportunity” for the individual to file for protections. In this
    case, the government had <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/23/g-s1-71529/supreme-court-south-sudan-deportation">given</a>
    the eight men mere hours to file for protection against their removal and
    had not informed them that they could file for such protections. These men
    were being sent to South Sudan, a country wracked by civil war, with more
    than 130,000 people being internally <a
      href="https://www.aljazeera.com/features/2025/5/6/we-are-suffering-displaced-families-bear-burden-of-south-sudan-conflict">displaced</a>
    in 2025 alone, and where the State Department has <a
      href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282404/gov.uscourts.mad.282404.112.2.pdf">warned</a>
    Americans not to travel to. </p>

  <p>However, the eight men who were headed to South Sudan did not make it
    there. Instead, the government took them to a US Navy Base in Camp
    Lemonnier, Djibouti where they are being held in a shipping container. <a
      href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.mad.282404/gov.uscourts.mad.282404.151.0_3.pdf">According</a>
    to a court declaration, there is limited lighting inside the container, the
    daily temperature outside exceeds 100 degrees, and there is an imminent
    threat of rocket attacks from terrorist groups in Yemen.</p>
  <p>In <a
      href="https://www.lawfaremedia.org/article/the-chaos-and-cruelty-of-dvd-v.-dhs">another</a>
    case, at least four men were removed to El Salvador without warning. They
    were all from Venezuela and had final orders of removal to Venezuela. Yet,
    the government had moved the men from the US to Guantanamo Bay and then to
    El Salvador without warning. It had been a clear violation of Judge Murphy’s
    court order, yet the government claimed it had not been a violation because
    the Defense Department, not DHS, flew the plane to El Salvador. It is
    difficult to imagine a situation in which the Defense Department would act
    on its own in this case, without DHS coordination, and if they did, it
    appears to raise new questions about what authority the Defense Department
    would have to carry out this action, as Judge Murphy had pointed out.</p>
  <p>Yet, the Supreme Court, in a 6-3 decision, <a
      href="https://www.supremecourt.gov/opinions/24pdf/24a1153_l5gm.pdf">stayed</a>
    Judge Murphy’s TRO pending a final ruling by the appeals court and/or the
    Supreme Court. It had done so via the shadow docket, issuing their decision
    without explaining how they came to the conclusion that they did. In Justice
    Sotomayor’s dissent, she pointed out that the court had ignored the clean
    hands doctrine in granting the stay. When considering whether to grant
    equitable relief, non-monetary relief such as injunctions and stays, courts
    are meant to consider whether the party seeking relief has “unclean hands.”
    In other words, as Sotomayor stated, “For centuries, courts have “close[d]
    the doors” of equity to those “tainted with inequitableness or bad faith
    relative to the matter in which [they] see[k] relief.” … That principle,
    “rooted in the historical concept of [the] court of equity as a vehicle for
    affirmatively enforcing the requirements of conscience and good faith,”
    ensures that courts do not become “‘abettor[s] of inequity.’”” However, the
    court ignores the fact that the government ignored the court’s order, as
    Judge Murphy had stated, and instead it grants equitable relief to the
    government who has unclean hands in this case. </p>

  <p>The implications of this Supreme Court ruling are cataclysmic. The highest
    court in the land has allowed the government to deport immigrants to
    countries they are not associated with and, certainly most strikingly,
    without an opportunity to challenge the deportation in court. As Sotomayor
    put it: “Apparently, the Court finds the idea that thousands will suffer
    violence in farflung locales more palatable than the remote possibility that
    a District Court exceeded its remedial powers when it ordered the Government
    to provide notice and process to which the plaintiffs are constitutionally
    and statutorily entitled.” </p>
  <p>Less than a day after the Supreme Court issued its ruling, Judge Murphy <a
      href="https://www.scotusblog.com/2025/06/trump-administration-claims-district-court-defied-supreme-courts-order-allowing-for-immigrants-deportation/">said</a>
    that the Supreme Court’s ruling does not affect the immigrants in Djibouti
    who are en route to South Sudan. The government has claimed that Judge
    Murphy is defying the Supreme Court’s ruling. It appears likely that the
    Supreme Court will have to clarify their ruling since they ruled on the stay
    via the shadow docket. But for now, all future deportations could involve
    the government giving little or no notice to immigrants before deporting
    them to a ‘third country.’</p>
