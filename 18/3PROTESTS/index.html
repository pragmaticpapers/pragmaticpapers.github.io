  <p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
  <p> Immigration enforcement has been central to the Trump Administration,
    rooted in long-standing campaign promises. In 2024, when Trump won
    reelection, the city of Los Angeles declared <a
      href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/l-a-to-become-a-sanctuary-city-for-migrants-in-response-to-trump-threat/">itself
      a sanctuary city</a> in response to his immigration policies. The Trump
    Admin immediately began focusing raids on <a

      cities across the country </a>to begin deporting undocumented immigrants.
  </p>
  <p> June 6th began the first series of clashes between ICE and protesters when
    a crowd gathered during an ICE raid happening in the<a

      Fashion District in LA</a>. Over the next week that followed, there were a
    series of protests, with some demonstrating violent and destructive
    behavior. Determining when something is officially a riot can be abstract,
    but the protests were declared an “<a
      href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/timeline-ice-raids-sparked-la-protests-prompted-trump/story?id=122688437&amp;utm_source">unlawful
      assembly</a>” five times with two of those occurring during the “<a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/riot-police-anti-ice-protesters-square-off-los-angeles-after-raids-2025-06-07/?utm_source">No
      Kings” Protests</a>. <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/pictures/scenes-streets-los-angeles-2025-06-10/">Several
      instances of property damage occurred</a>, particularly to government
    buildings and Waymo driverless cars. Authorities reported 561 arrests,
    mostly for<a
      href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/more-than-500-arrests-made-over-8-days-of-protests-in-los-angeles/">
      curfew or failure to disperse violations</a> and looting. Ten individuals
    were arrested for more serious offenses like assault on police officers,
    firearm possession, assault with a deadly weapon and attempted murder for
    throwing a Molotov cocktail . The Department of Justice has brought charges
    against <a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/13/protester-charged-ice-los-angeles?utm_source">nine
      people</a> for assaulting, resisting, or impeding federal officers. </p>
  <p> A central conflict during the protests was over accountability: whether
    local officials lost control or federal escalation caused unnecessary
    unrest. The Trump Administration and Congressional Republicans state that
    Governor Gavin Newsom and Mayor Karen Bass made <a
      href="https://oversight.house.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/06/DOJ-and-FBI-LA-Riots-Letter_6.13.2025.pdf">false
      claims of having the protests under control</a> and blaming President
    Trump for the actions of violent rioters. They assert Trump had to send in
    the National Guard because the situation was out of control. They are
    investigating the matter and have requested internal communications between
    Newsom and Bass regarding how they addressed the protests.</p>
  <p> Governor Newsom denies underplaying the seriousness and states the
    protests did not reach a level that was beyond local law enforcement’s
    ability to handle. He stated the riots are a direct reaction to Trump’s
    aggressive deportation policy and that involving the military would escalate
    the issue, lead to more violence, and violate the Constitution. He <a
      href="https://www.gov.ca.gov/2025/06/09/governor-newsom-suing-president-trump-and-department-of-defense-for-illegal-takeover-of-calguard-unit/">is
      suing the government over the matter</a>.</p>

  </div>
  <p> The cost of the unrest is significant, both financially and politically.
    In the most straightforward way, the cost to cover the law enforcement
    response, tactical deployments, and clean up is estimated to run LA
    taxpayers about <a
      href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/los-angeles-protest-related-costs-rise-to-over-32-million/3729152/#:~:text=Los%20Angeles%20has%20spent%20more,tactical%20deployments%20and%20overtime%20operations.">$34
      million</a>. This pales in comparison to the <a
      href="https://nypost.com/2025/06/22/us-news/anti-ice-protests-to-cost-los-angeles-taxpayers-over-30m-official/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=The%20Pentagon%20revealed%20earlier%20this%20month%20that%20President%20Trump%E2%80%99s%20decision%20to%20deploy%C2%A0the%20National%20Guard%20and%20Marines%20to%20LA%C2%A0to%20quell%20the%20unrest%20could%20cost%20up%20to%20%24134%20million.%C2%A0">$134
      million price tag</a> for federalizing the National Guard and deploying
    the Marines.</p>
  <p> The political outcome is still being determined. During and after the
    protests, the Trump Administration remained confident in their mission.
    Trump called the <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/09/us/trump-los-angeles-protestors-insurrectionists.html">protesters
      "insurrectionists"</a>, Secretary Noem said that LA needed to be liberated
    from i<a
      href="https://www.msnbc.com/opinion/msnbc-opinion/kristi-noem-alex-padilla-detained-los-angeles-ice-rcna212764">ts
      burdensome leadership</a>, and Vice <a
      href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/vice-president-vance-los-angeles-immigration/3728750/">President
      JD Vance </a>said LA needed to be liberated from immigrants and called
    Senator Alex Padilla “Jose”. </p>
  <p> <a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/19/trump-immigration-raids-farms-hotels-border-czar">Changes
      did seem to be coming</a> after Trump announced on Truth Social that his
    aggressive policies were consequential for farmers or hospitality workers,
    who, in many cases, were very good people. He stated changes were to be
    expected but since then, Tom Homan, the border czar, has stated that raids
    on farms and hotels will continue.</p>
  <p> <a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/16/trump-ice-democrat-cities-immigration-deport">Trump
      has also announced</a> the future focus of immigration enforcement will be
    on Democrat-run cities.</p>
  <p><strong>Ways the media reports the issue:</strong></p>
  <p> There are two larger issues compounding here: how to handle immigration
    and how to effectively protest government policy. The issue of undocumented
    immigration and illegal border crossings has been a long-standing challenge
    in the U.S. with no lasting political consensus despite decades of debate.
    Trump ran on immigration and aggressive enforcement was a central campaign
    promise but even for his own constituency, there are cold feet when seeing
    it pan out. </p>
  <p> We are a country built on protest but that doesn’t mean we are effective
    at it. When does protest become rioting? Were there even riots in LA?</p>
  <p>Depending on your media diet, you fall on the spectrum anywhere from LA is
    the seventh circle of hell consumed with homeless, drug-addled undocumented
    immigrants rioting against the Trump Administration, to locals protesting
    bravely for their family and neighbors being targeted by a racist, Trump
    regime. Let's look at both sides. </p>

  <p> From the perspective of those on the right, sanctuary cities are a problem
    because it incentivizes illegal immigration and strains local social
    services. Sanctuary cities are places that limit or refuse to work with
    federal authorities to enforce immigration law. Since so many undocumented
    immigrants have moved to these sanctuary cities, and local authorities won’t
    help with immigration enforcement, Trump has no choice but to send ICE into
    the places where they know the immigrants will be. The city's policies to
    protect undocumented immigrants and aggressive policies toward federal law
    enforcement is what is causing the protests and riots.</p>
  <p> As far as the left is concerned, sanctuary cities are a necessity to
    functional policing after years of failed border policies has allowed local
    illegal immigrant populations to grow so large. The local government must
    rely on their citizens to aid in investigations by reporting illegal
    activity. Undocumented immigrants will limit their interaction with local
    law enforcement if they have to worry about immigration enforcement. Also,
    enforcing immigration policy is the jurisdiction of the federal government.
    Local departments are better served with focusing their resources on
    policies that better service their citizens. There are also several studies
    that have shown<a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sanctuary_city#:~:text=Studies%20show%20that%20US%20sanctuary%20cities%20either%20have%20no%20impact%20on%20crime%20or%20that%20they%20lower%20the%20crime%20rate.%5B4%5D%5B65%5D%5B66%5D%5B67%5D%5B68%5D%5B3%5D%5B69%5D%5B70%5D%5B5%5D">
      undocumented immigrants are less likely to participate in criminal
      activity</a> and are a net positive for the economy since they are largely
    ineligible for most public benefits they contribute to. Lastly, the protests
    are due to Trump’s aggressive immigration enforcement that is targeting
    immigrants that are employed and integrated into the communities.</p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>My very meandering (I don’t know what to do) take…</strong></p>
  <p> In almost every situation, riots or protests that involve property damage
    are bad (I know, so brave…). But I want these protests to work. And I don’t
    know how to direct that. There’s a tension gripping the U.S. that’s been
    brewing long before Trump, though he certainly poured gas on it. It started
    bubbling on the right with the Tea Party, but now it’s metastasized — this
    two-headed dog is trying to tug the country right and left.</p>
  <p> History shows that with every innovative leap of human communication,
    chaos ensued. The printing press unseated the Catholic Church. The telegraph
    accelerated the polarization that led to the Civil War. Radio and TV helped
    march the world into war. These innovations didn’t just spread information,
    they exploded control.</p>
  <p> When looking at history, the internet most closely mirrors the printing
    press. It was easily accessible and unregulated, like the internet today.
    The print press was the tool used by Martin Luther to expose the church’s
    use of indulgences to profit from salvation. Most people had to rely on
    clergy trained to read Latin to tell them what the bible said, until it was
    translated, and the church exposed. </p>
  <p>The similarities to today are telling, but also present a completely new
    problem. Instead of accessing scripture gate-kept behind another language,
    people can access peer reviewed articles or fringe conspiracy theorists
    about whatever topic their algorithm provides. Also, because many
    institutions already had policies to address conflicts, like announcing
    conflicts of interest or publishing the results of investigations, people
    could also see the messy side of science and government, maybe for the first
    time.. </p>
  <p>Our institutions aren’t hiding the truth. We’re just no longer taught how
    to recognize it. Shows like <em>Criminal Minds</em> have convinced people
    that highly trained behavioral analysts travel the country solving murders
    with hacker sidekicks and personality quirks. I’ve worked in criminal
    justice for two decades. I have a master’s in forensic psych. I hate that
    fucking show. </p>
  <p>But it's not just crime TV. In medical dramas they always find the cure.
    Political shows glamorize backroom deals that never happen. Even feel-good
    sitcoms romanticize industries they don’t understand. And that distortion
    bleeds into public expectations. We expect god-like expertise from people
    who are underpaid, understaffed, and painfully human.</p>
  <p>So, back to the two headed dog. We have a country that is polarized and
    digging in their heels until they get the world they want. They don’t
    consider the nuance of the problem or the consequences of what they want.
  </p>
  <p>How do you get them to listen? Riots? Protests? </p>
  <p>Riots and property damage almost never help. Not because it’s morally
    wrong, but because it doesn’t <em>work</em>. It doesn’t change minds. The
    anti-ICE protests? The violence made it easier for Trump to call Democrats
    violent, for moderates to look away, for the press to shift the narrative.
    Peaceful protests don’t move Trump, but violence only confirms his
    narrative.</p>
  <p>The truth is, we need a form of protest that hurts<strong> </strong>the
    people in power but wins over the people on the fence.. And no, I have no
    idea what that is.</p>
  <p>I just know it’s not a riot. Not yet. But keep it in your back pocket.</p>
