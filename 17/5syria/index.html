  <p><strong>Syria’s New Dawn Appears Darkly Authoritarian </strong></p>
  <p>Thomas R Ullmann </p>
  <p>June 22, 2025 </p>
  <p><strong>Abstract </strong></p>
  <p>In December 2024, a lightning rebel offensive culminated in the fall of
    Bashar al-Assad’s regime, offering hope for a Syria devastated by over a
    decade of war. Since then, interim President Ahmad al-Sharaa has adopted a
    veneer of inclusive rhetoric, yet the substance of his reforms tells a
    different story. This article explores the developments under Syria’s new
    interim government, reflecting upon Syria’s emerging trajectory; including
    the consequences for women and minorities, as well as future alliances. </p>
  <p><strong>A new start </strong></p>
  <p>In December 2024, as al-Assad fled to Russia, Syria’s rebel coalition
    revelled in the raucous cheer of Syrians who had survived barrel bombs,
    siege, and starvation. </p>
  <p><em>"The tyrant Bashar al-Assad has fled. We declare Damascus liberated."
    </em>[26] claimed the rebels. </p>
  <p>The proclamation was cathartic, yet fragile. The rebels; Hay’at Tahrir
    al-Sham (HTS), Turkish backed Syrian National Army (SNA), the Kurdish Syrian
    Democratic Forces (SDF), and southern Free Syrian (FSA) remnants shared only
    one common plank, <em>Never again Damascus under Assad</em>. </p>
  <p>Within seventy-two hours of victory, the clatter of guns returned to the
    outskirts of Aleppo as SNA and SDF patrols fought over roadblocks. In the
    capital, HTS’s elite <em>Red Bands </em>secured ministries while the
    Southern Operations Room, an uneasy confederation of former FSA outfits,
    argued it had bled for the city and deserved equal say. The revolution’s
    after party was already cracking with HTS dominating over all other groups.
  </p>
  <p><strong>The interim government, constitution, and judiciary </strong></p>
  <p>On 13 March 2025 President al-Sharaa, leader of the HTS, unveiled a
    forty-four article <em>Constitutional Declaration </em>[1]. Article 1
    rebrands the state "Syrian Islamic Republic," signalling the ideological
    pivot. Article 3, one of the most decisive in determining the legal
    trajectory, reads in full, </p>
  <p><em>"Islamic jurisprudence (Sharia) shall be the </em><strong><em>principal
      </em></strong><em>source of legislation; no law shall contravene its
      provisions." </em></p>
  <p>The clause revokes the 2012 constitution’s half-secular compromise and
    partially echoes Iran’s 1979 text. </p>
  <p>Although two-thirds of the People’s Assembly seats are supposed to be
    chosen through an indirect election overseen by a newly formed Supreme
    Committee, Article 24 of the 13 March </p>
  <p>2025 Constitutional Declaration still lets the president appoint the
    remaining one-third[27]. A presidential Decree installed an HTS-leaning
    Supreme Committee whose members now draft the eligibility rules[28, 29].

    Palace in Damascus, Syria in this undated handout image released on January
    30, 2025. Syrian Presidency/Handout via REUTERS</p>
  <p>Given Article 41 simultaneously empowers the president to proclaim an
    open-ended state of emergency, independent analysts warn that the committee
    can strike out any nominee it labels "anti-revolutionary," a loophole
    already criticised by civil-society observers[30, 31]. Human Rights Watch
    likewise cautions that the whole framework <em>"risks consolidating
      executive control at the expense of fundamental freedoms."</em>[32] </p>
  <p>Whilst reference to human rights is included in the constitution, ambiguity
    is fostered when Sharia law is considered the principle source of
    legislation. As such the determining factor will be the appointments to
    Syria’s new supreme constitutional court and how the constitution will be
    interpreted. </p>
  <p>In the interim the president may legislate by decree "in exigent
    circumstances," ratify treaties without parliamentary consent, dissolve the
    People’s Assembly after six months, and hand-pick ten of the Supreme
    Constitutional Court’s fifteen judges [2]. Ominously, according to the draft
    constitution of March 2025, the new court will comprise seven members, all
    to be appointed by President al-Sharaa[15]. </p>
  <p>Such a collection of power suggests a sensitivity to corruption and a
    strong proneness to an ideological bent. This change from ten of the
    fifteen, to all seven judges marks an ever increasing concentration of power
    around the presidency. </p>
  <p>Western observers warned the draft <em>"builds an Islamist republic atop
      Ba’athist scaffolding," </em>combining Assad-era presidentialism with
    clerical veto [3, 4]. Turkish officials privately applauded the strong
    presidency, calculating that al-Sharaa’s dependence on Ankara’s logistics
    grants Turkey leverage over border security and refugee repatriation. </p>
  <p>Several of the most influential ministries including Interior, Defence,
    Foreign Affairs, and Justice are led by individuals with direct ties to HTS,
    specifically Anas Khattab (Interior), Murhaf Abu Qasra (Defence), Asaad
    al-Shaibani (Foreign Affairs), and Mazhar al-Wais (Justice) [33]. </p>
  <p>These appointments ensure that core areas of state power-security, foreign
    policy (as well as the increased power of the president's hand over the
    judiciary) remain firmly under the influence of the HTS [34]. As is made
    clear in the section of this article on how the HTS has governed Idlib this
    does not bode well for the last remnants of secularism in Syria. </p>
  <p>Under article 52 of the constitution Presidential elections are to follow
    within five years, following a full census and drafting of a permanent
    constitution [1]. In order to amend the constitution requires a two thirds
    majority of the People’s Assembly which is significantly influenced by the
    president and with no genuine oversight. Hence, the scope for scepticism
    should be maintained, the likelihood of elections in this time frame appears
    doubtful. </p>
  <p><strong>Policing reforms </strong></p>
  <p>HTS inherited Assad’s police academies but not his secular syllabus. A
    ten-day induction now replaces the former nine-month diploma, </p>
  <p>• <strong>Days 1-3. </strong><em>Fiqh </em>foundations, memorising
    <em>hadith </em>on the duties of the <em>hisba</em>. </p>
  <p>• <strong>Days 4-6. </strong>Riot drills, crowd herding, detainee triage,
    and a module on moral infractions: unveiled hair, public smoking during
    Ramadan, mixed-gender cafés. </p>
  <p>• <strong>Days 7-10. </strong>Ballistics basics, checkpoint vernacular, and
    a written test on twenty-five Quranic versespass mark 90 %. </p>
  <p>[35] </p>
  <p>Graduates receive a green armband and Glock-17. Desertion is punishable by
    confiscation of family property, an Ottoman relic revived for discipline.
  </p>
  <p>A longer nine month academy, drafted by Idlib University’s College of
    Sharia and Law, promises courses in comparative <em>fiqh</em>(Islamic
    jurisprudence), criminal procedure, evidence, and a practicum in HTS-run
    courts [6]. Secular lawyers note what is missing: forensics, cyber-crime, or
    the UN’s <em>Basic Principles on the Use of Force</em>. Human-rights NGOs
    report the first batch of 600 graduates is already policing Idlib City,
    handing down on-the-spot lashings for petty theft [7]. It is clear from the
    syllabus that the police will take on some of the role of <em>morality
      policing </em>seen in states such as Iran. </p>
  <p>There are strong indicators that the interim government is deliberately
    using Idlib as a template, from police reform to other areas of governance.
    Economy Minister Basel Abdel Hannan told Reuters the interim authorities are
    aiming to extend the Idlib model.[51] </p>
  <p><strong>Idlib Governance under the HTS </strong></p>
  <p>Ahmad al-Sharaa and HTS, while rooted in al-Qaeda’s Syrian branch (Jabhat
    al-Nusra prior to 2016), have formally severed ties and publicly renounced
    transnational jihadism-repositioning themselves as a localized Islamist
    movement focused on governance and national interests. It would thus be
    unfair to solely judge their current positions and actions based upon their
    past. </p>
  <p>Instead their actions in governance of Idlib province serves as a blueprint
    for what can be expected from national rule. HTS established the Syrian
    Salvation Government (SSG) as a de facto administration managing local
    governance, education, taxation, and public services. </p>
  <p>Sharia law includes explicit reference to punishments such as amputations
    or stonings yet some of the most severe penalties have not been enacted
    since 2021 when the last stoning occurred with three women stoned for
    adultery[16] The SSG has disavowed <em>hudud </em>punishments as of late
    2024. However, lashings continued to be a regular form of punishment for
    alcohol consumption and minor theft. To quote the US commission on
    International Religious Freedom <em>HTS courts continue to impose
      discretionary penalties (tazr), including public lashings, often for moral
      or religious infractions.</em>[17] </p>
  <p>Civil disputes in Idlib are adjudicated under a hybrid legal system, in
    which SSG courts apply a mix of Sharia, remnants of the Ottoman Majalla, the
    1949 French-inspired Civil Code, and tribal customary law -a patchwork
    arrangement that outsiders often describe as chaotic, but which HTS portrays
    as a deliberate, multi-layered form of legitimacy grounded in local
    tradition and Islamic jurisprudence [18]. </p>
  <p>A leaked 128-article "Public Morality Law," obtained by Enab Baladi in
    January 2024, established a new branch inside Idlib’s Interior Ministry
    <em>Markaz al-Fal </em>charged with "upholding public virtue" throughout
    HTS-controlled territory [36]. </p>
  <p>The Dutch Foreign Ministry’s 2021 country-of-origin report confirms that
    HTS reorganised its earlier <em>hisba </em>under the same name in May 2020,
    folding it into the movement’s wider security services [37]. </p>
  <p>A USCIRF November 2022 factsheet states that Markaz al-Fal patrols enforce
    Islamic dress codes, gender segregation, and Ramadan observance, with
    authority to arrest and detain violators [38]. </p>
  <p>3</p>
  <p>The Institute for the Study of War (ISW) documents recent cases in which
    the morality police detained women for "inappropriate" dress and journalists
    critical of HTS, highlighting the unit’s role in social control rather than
    conventional policing [39]. </p>
  <p>Indeed, women’s mobility in Idlib is still constrained by a de-facto
    male-guardianship (<em>mahram</em>) regime. The EU Agency for Asylum
    recorded that <em>in some parts of Idlib women and girls were required to be
      accompanied by a male guardian (mahram) </em>and that HTS checkpoints vet
    female passengers for compliance[21]. A draft <em>Public Morality Law
    </em>leaked in January 2024 would formalise this rule: Article 16 prohibits
    gender mixing in public <strong>except with proof of mahram </strong>and
    mandates a specialised Morality Police to detain violators[22]. </p>
  <p>Field reporting from October 2021 documents Hisbah patrols that
    <em>detained </em>a woman and a shop keeper because she was "inside the shop
    alone, without a mahram," and publicly reprimanded another woman in Idlib
    Park over "eye-catching" dress[23]. </p>
  <p>USCIRF’s 2022 factsheet likewise notes that Markaz al-Falah, HTS’s morality
    force, arrests women for being "inappropriately dressed" or for moving about
    without a guardian[38]. Zelin's 2022 study, citing UN Commission of Inquiry
    case files, lists repeated incidents, including June 2017 assaults in the
    Idlib city market, where women were <em>beaten, flogged, or imprisoned
    </em>for travelling without a mahram[25]. </p>
  <p>Taken together these sources show that, although the guardianship rule is
    not yet enshrined in a promulgated statute, it is routinely enforced through
    moral-police patrols; punishments range from verbal humiliation and fines to
    short-term detention and, in documented cases, corporal violence. </p>
  <p>This year women’s activist Ghalia Rahhal in reference to how women were
    marginalized under the HTS in Idlib stated <em>In general, I don’t trust HTS
      because I still don't know whether they are truly changing or they just
      claim to have changed, </em>she said. <em>Are they really changing
      ideologically, or just for their own interests?</em>[14] </p>
  <p>Meanwhile Syria itself steps towards the Idlib model with HTS authorities
    having issued a decree requiring women on public beaches and pools to wear
    full-body swimwear (e.g. burkinis). The Ministry of Tourism frames these
    rules as measures to respect <em>"public morals and cultural values." </em>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Media and civil society clampdown </strong></p>
  <p>On 9 April 2025 the interim government passed a "Public Information Purity
    Law" criminalising "false or harmful portrayal of Islamic governance." The
    law fines foreign reporters US$20 000 per infraction and obliges local
    outlets to employ a certified <em>sharia </em>reviewer. Reporters Without
    Borders now ranks Syria 178/180 on its 2025 Press Freedom Index [11].
    Popular satirist Maher al-Tahan disappeared after mocking HTS interior
    minister Ali al-Jassem on Telegram. Graffiti of a gagged cartoon crow-the
    new symbol of censored speech-adorns Homs back-alleys; HTS paints it over
    each dawn, only for the bird to re-emerge by dusk. </p>
  <p>Civil society groups face a bureaucratic licence maze: registration at the
    Ministry of Endowments, yearly loyalty audit, and a clerical board seat for
    "moral oversight." Women’s literacy NGO <em>Noura </em>closed after clerics
    demanded segregated classrooms with opaque partitions. An Amnesty field
    report lists 127 activists detained between February and May 2025 [12]. </p>

  <p>Figure 1: Estimated current ethnic composition of Syria. ’Other’ includes
    Druze, Armenians, Circassians, Turkmens, and other smaller ethnic groups
    [13]. </p>
  <p><strong>Political transition and inclusion </strong></p>
  <p>The March 2025 "National Dialogue" convened 148 delegates in the shuttered
    People’s Assembly hall. Assad-era Baathists and the SDF’s Autonomous
    Administration were uninvited. Twenty four seats went to HTS clerics, ten to
    Ankara-vetted technocrats, and eight were reserved for "patriotic
    minorities"-a Druze hotelier, two Syriac doctors, a sole Alawite sheikh.
  </p>
  <p>With the main ministries firmly under HTS control the handful of non-HTS
    examples of non HTS ministers are the Druze tourism minister presiding over
    cratered heritage sites; two Chris tian deputies administer health and
    telecoms, portfolios without budgets. Additionally, the new electoral law
    requires candidates to swear allegiance to <em>Sharia </em>and "the
    sacrifices of the jihad." </p>
  <p>Meanwhile a March 2025 EUAA country-focus report records that Druze
    villages in Suwayda formed a separate "Military Council" after at least
    seventy property seizures and over fifty kidnappings allegedly carried out
    by HTS-linked security units, warning of rising <em>"sectarian violence and
      forced conversion pressures."</em>[41] On 2 May 2025 Reuters reported that
    Sunni Islamist militants stormed the Druze village of al-Soura al-Kubra,
    killing a dozen civilians and prompting an emergency army deployment,an
    episode local elders said showed "HTSs contempt for Druze autonomy."[42] The
    2025 <em>Open Doors </em>World Watch List further notes that in HTS-run
    Idlib and western Aleppo, Christians face bans on church bells, public
    worship, and rebuilding of damaged sanctuaries, calling the northwest
    "Syria's most dangerous zone for historic churches."[43] </p>
  <p>Kurdish-led authorities in northeast Syria remain in control of
    approximately 25% of the country's territory and are negotiating with
    Damascus to secure decentralised governance, including the right to teach
    Kurdish in schools and celebrate Nowruz (kurdish new year) openly [45, 46].
    This was strictly forbidden under the Assad regime with many Kurds unable to
    read their own language. </p>
  <p>So far HTS’s response to Kurdish calls for federalism is to redraw
    districts, diluting Kurdish votes with SNA-held Arab villages. </p>
  <p>Since the collapse of the Assad regime, Turkish-backed forces, including
    the Syrian National Army, have captured key Kurdish-held towns such as
    Manbij and Tel Rifaat, displacing over 100,000 Kurdish civilians [47, 45].
    As of 10th March an agreement between interim President al-Sharaa and SDF
    commander Mazloum Abdi commits to integrating much of the SDF into state
    institutions by year-end, alongside control of border crossings and
    oilfields [48, 49]. </p>
  <p>However, Kurdish protests erupted in Qamishli on 14th March over the
    constitutional declaration, as demonstrators complained it failed to
    guarantee minority rights or federalism, demanding "democratic and federal"
    reforms. </p>
  <p>5</p>
  <p>Overall minorities face an increasingly uncertain future in Syria with
    actions rarely matching verbal assurances. </p>
  <p><strong>Comparative analysis: Similarities with Iran? </strong></p>
  <p>Iran’s revolution offers a disquieting mirror. Both states adopted
    constitutions naming <em>Sharia </em>the chief legislative font and
    empowering revolutionary guards to "protect the revolution." In deed, like
    in Syria the revolutionaries were a broad coalition before the islamists
    marginalised and punished the other factions.[44] </p>
  <p>However, Syria lacks Iran’s single <em>faqih </em>(an Islamic jurist).
    Instead, HTS’s Central Sharia Council, a ten-man college, vets laws and
    presidential decrees. This appears closer to Qatar’s Council of Senior
    Scholars in model. </p>
  <p>Whilst Egypt’s 2014 charter speaks of <em>principles of Sharia, </em>Coptic
    Christians still head courts. Morocco’s constitution subordinates clergy to
    a monarch styled <em>"Commander of the Faithful." </em></p>
  <p>Syria’s experiment is harsher than all but the Iranian example. Clerics
    wield veto power without a monarch’s moderating prestige. The final form of
    Syria’s theocratic authoritarianism looks to fall somewhere between the
    Qatari and Iran’s theocracy though could tend towards Afghanistan’s raw
    Emirate. </p>
  <p><strong>Economic and Humanitarian Fallout </strong></p>
  <p>Victory did not stop the bleeding economy. The Syrian pound (SYP), trading
    at SYP 14 000 per US dollar under Assad, crashed to SYP 21 500 by May 2025.
    The IMF’s Staff Monitor Report warns hyper-inflation could top 700 % by
    year-end [9]. Basic staples-bulgur (a grain similar to couscous), lentils,
    and diesel-are priced in Turkish lira to dodge the spiral, binding northern
    Syria’s economy to Ankara. </p>
  <p>Humanitarian agencies register 680 000 newly displaced since January 2025,
    chiefly minorities fearing Islamisation [10]. Bread lines snake past
    shuttered bakeries; diesel rationing limits hospital generators to four
    hours per day. Doctors Without Borders reports paediatric malnutrition in
    Idlib at 14 %, the highest since 2016. Yet al-Sharaa’s cabinet slashed UN
    cooperation, accusing Western NGOs of "cultural sabotage." </p>
  <p><strong>Outlook and Implications </strong></p>
  <p>Absent external shocks, Syria is drifting toward an
    <strong>Islamist-authoritarian hybrid</strong>. A presidential strongman
    fenced by clerical review, elections filtered through loyalty vetting, and
    law enforced by a policing caste trained more in <em>fiqh </em>than
    forensics. Western sanctions may fragment, Brussels debates limited
    reconstruction funds should refugees return but Washington’s sanctions
    framework endures. </p>
  <p>Whilst the west hesitates to engage with an emerging authoritarian state,
    Turkey sees a buffer against both Kurdish ambitions and Iranian influence;
    Qatar spots a frontier market for its sovereign-wealth billions. In its
    vulnerability, Syria could quite easily fall into a dependency with these
    states in return for alliance. Furthermore, the strongman figure may appeal
    to RecepErdoan, the Turkish president. </p>
  <p>Iran now weakened by war with both Israel and the US whilst nursing proxy
    militias near Aleppo, eyes the Sunni ascendancy warily. Iran and Syria are
    natural foes with the new Syrian regime maintaining silence, apparently
    refusing to condemn the attacks on Iranian soil. Little is also said that
    Israeli jets are routinely flying over Syrian airspace. </p>
  <p>Israel, ever pragmatic, will tolerate the new regime so long as rockets
    stay clear of the Golan heights. Israeli prime minister Netanyahu has
    signalled that normalisation is contingent on Syria refraining from any
    support for Hezbollah. Nevertheless, Israel currently occupies western
    regions of Syria with Syria demanding withdrawal. If Israel was to appear
    vulnerable, and Syria forges alliances with Qatar and Turkey a harder line
    against Israel would become a lot more probable. </p>
  <p>Quietly Russia continues to supply arms and maintain military cooperation
    with Syria. Moscow is negotiating to retain its strategic air and naval
    bases at Khmeimim and Tartus, offering ongoing deliveries of hardware and
    diplomatic support.[50]. It is this possible alliance that would ensure a
    wedge between Syria and western nations. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile 25 million Syrians confront soaring food prices, medics ration
    diesel, and comedians paint mute crows on ruined walls, representing the
    suppression of free speech. The revolution promised dawn yet the sun has yet
    to rise. </p>
  <p>Should a judiciary stacked with wartime clerics define Syria’s future, the
    post-Assad dusk may prove longer and darker than the night it replaced. </p>
  <p>Meanwhile Syria awaits its first ever free and fair election. </p>
