  <p>Sunday, June 15th, Russia carried out another wave of drone and missile
    strikes across Ukraine, continuing its <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/15/europe/russia-tactics-swarms-of-killer-drones-intl-cmd">shift
      toward heavy reliance on Shahed drones</a>, an Iranian-designed loitering
    munition now being mass-produced inside Russia. An estimated 2,700 of these
    Shahed drones and 2,500 decoys are produced monthly, allowing Moscow to
    carry out nightly barrages of up to 300 to 400 drones, assuming their prior
    estimated surplus remains intact. By all accounts, that seems to be exactly
    what is happening, as seven of the largest drone attacks of the entire war
    have occurred in just the past month. It’s worth noting as well: Ukraine
    does manage to intercept the vast majority of these, but battlefield tactics
    are shifting. Previously, drones were flown low to avoid air defense
    munitions. Now, with the United States redirecting those munitions to the
    Middle East, they’re flown high to evade the machine gun emplacements that
    were once so effective. And while the recent mineral deal was pitched as a
    layer of security, suggesting Russia would think twice before attacking U.S.
    companies in the region, one of <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/russian-air-attack-damaged-boeing-offices-ukraine-ft-reports-2025-06-15/">Boeing’s
      buildings</a> was struck in a recent attack. Boeing and the American
    Chamber of Commerce declined to comment.</p>
  <p>On Monday, June 16th, a new round of Russian demands emerged from ongoing
    talks, with <a
      href="https://kyivindependent.com/russia-demands-ukraine-destroy-western-weapons-to-end-war/">Deputy
      Foreign Minister Alexander Grushko</a> stating that Ukraine must destroy
    all Western-supplied weapons as part of any potential ceasefire deal. The
    statement was part of a broader, so-called “peace memorandum” presented
    during negotiations in Istanbul on June 2nd, which includes demands for
    Ukraine to recognize Russian annexation of occupied territories, withdraw
    its troops entirely, and permanently halt all Western military cooperation.
    Grushko argued that Western weapons pose a threat not only to Russia but to
    Europe at large, pushing the same familiar narrative about arms flooding
    black markets, a claim that’s been repeatedly debunked by international
    monitors.</p>
  <p>On Tuesday, June 17th, reports began to emerge that the <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/trump-administration-disbands-group-focused-pressuring-russia-sources-say-2025-06-17/">Trump
      administration</a> had quietly disbanded an inter-agency working group
    developed with the goal of pressuring the Kremlin into peace talks. This
    group, according to three U.S. officials, included members of the State
    Department, Pentagon, Treasury, and intelligence community, and had lost
    both momentum and favor with Trump back in May as he seemed to show less and
    less interest in taking a harder stance against Putin. There’s so much here
    that is so painful to write—I’ve tried to highlight points in previous
    weekly updates where it seemed like Trump may have been moving to support
    Ukraine or pressure Russia, and to learn that, well, actually anything
    positive I’ve written in regards to him for the past two months was just
    false… sucks. The disbanding of the group doesn’t just seem to be affecting
    guys like me who spend too much time on the internet, though, as it has been
    noted as deeply concerning for our allies as well, obviously. And while some
    Republicans are still pushing for increased sanctions against Russia, Trump
    and those close to him seem to continue signaling that they’re in favor of
    just walking away.</p>

  <p>On Wednesday, June 18th, the <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/parliament-passes-law-allow-multiple-citizenship-ukrainians-2025-06-18/">Ukrainian
      parliament passed a major law allowing citizens to hold dual or multiple
      citizenships</a>, a shift aimed at reuniting a nearly 25 million-strong
    Ukrainian diaspora and marking the first steps toward combating a growing
    demographic crisis after these recent years of full-scale war. Until now,
    Ukraine did not allow dual citizenship, which meant any foreigner born
    abroad had to renounce their previous citizenship in order to obtain
    Ukrainian citizenship. And now, with nearly 5 million Ukrainians living in
    Europe and Ukraine’s total population sitting at only 32 million, the hope
    is that those 5 million will still wish to return—even if they take up
    citizenship in the countries they’re currently residing in while the war
    rages on. There’s also another angle to this: Ukraine’s foreign or
    international legions are extremely diverse, and anecdotally, many of those
    I know serving in the International Legion have grown to love Ukraine but
    feared either losing their home country’s citizenship or just the brutal and
    lengthy process it took to gain Ukrainian citizenship. Regardless, it seems
    Ukraine is wanting to keep with Western liberal tradition in that more
    opportunities and choices are always better than fewer.</p>
  <p>Thursday, June 19th, <a
      href="https://www.pressdemocrat.com/article/news/zelenskyy-calls-for-more-pressure-on-russia-after-deadly-kyiv-missile-strik/">President
      Zelenskyy once again called for greater international pressure on
      Moscow</a> after a deadly missile strike leveled a residential building in
    Kyiv earlier in the week, killing 28 and injuring over 140 others across the
    city. Of those killed, 23 died when a missile collapsed a nine-story
    apartment complex in the Solomianskyi district. Zelenskyy visited the site
    with other officials Thursday morning, laying flowers and stating plainly
    that “Russia rejects a ceasefire and chooses killing.” This latest attack
    was again part of one of the largest bombardments of the war so far, with
    over 440 drones and 32 missiles launched across Ukraine. As Putin continues
    his summer offensive and increasingly targets urban residential areas, he
    still insists no such targets are being hit, stating instead that strikes
    are only aimed at “military industries.” Meanwhile, in St. Petersburg, Putin
    praised Trump’s efforts to push for peace but rejected a proposed 30-day
    ceasefire unless Ukraine halts mobilization and the West cuts off arms.
    Zelenskyy responded by pointing out that Ukraine had already unconditionally
    accepted the U.S. proposal, and that Russia has spent the 100 days since
    escalating its attacks.</p>

  <p>Friday, June 20th, <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/20/world/europe/russia-putin-ukraine.html">Putin
      again made very clear what his intentions are in an odd slew of unhinged
      statements delivered at an economic forum in St. Petersburg</a>. When
    speaking about the northern Ukrainian city of Sumy, he stated that while
    there is currently no official goal to seize the city, he “doesn’t exclude
    it in principle,” following it up with, to me, the most mask-off line yet:
    <em>“Wherever a Russian soldier steps foot, that’s ours.”</em> So, for every
    single MAGA and tankie online arguing that this war has anything to do with
    NATO expansionism, or anything other than Putin’s Nazi-like ideology, do
    your best to remind them of this. Putin then doubled down, channeling his
    inner fascist, claiming that Ukrainians and Russians are “one people,” and
    that all of Ukraine, in his own words, already belongs to Russia. While for
    every sane person this has been obvious for a long time, to hear it stated
    plainly and publicly yet again almost makes you feel like you’re losing your
    mind. And while I’m sure the goalposts will move for MAGA and the far left,
    perhaps some will just own this for what it is, but either way, this should
    be reason enough for us to donate or fight however we can. Ukraine must win.

  <p>Saturday, June 21st, <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/ukraine-asks-allies-allocate-025-gdp-boost-its-weapon-production-2025-06-21/">President
      Zelenskyy formally requested that Ukraine’s allies allocate 0.25% of their
      GDP to boost Ukraine’s domestic weapons production</a>, something he
    called critical as the war escalates and Kyiv scrambles to match Russia’s
    military output. Ukraine has reportedly secured $43 billion this year to
    fund its own weapons industry and is now pushing for joint production deals
    with countries like Germany, Canada, the UK, and Lithuania. Zelenskyy
    emphasized that Ukraine already covers around 40% of its defense needs
    internally but wants to increase this capacity dramatically, not just for
    the war effort but for long-term security. He also announced plans to begin
    exporting weapon production technologies to European partners through a
    program called “Build with Ukraine,” which would establish production lines
    abroad for things like drones, missiles, and possibly artillery. And while
    NATO’s upcoming summit in The Hague will focus on broader defense spending,
    with Secretary General Rutte proposing a 5% GDP commitment across the
    alliance, Zelenskyy’s push is aimed at making sure Ukraine doesn’t just
    survive but becomes a cornerstone of European defense moving forward.</p>
