  <p>…since you know as well as we do that right, as the world goes, is only in
    question between equals in power, while the strong do what they can and the
    weak suffer what they must.</p>
  <p>- Thucydides, <em>History of the Peloponnesian War</em>, Book 5, Ch. 88</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>What passing-bells for these who die as cattle? Only the monstrous anger of
    the guns. Only the stuttering rifles' rapid rattle can patter out their
    hasty orisons. No mockeries now for them; no prayers nor bells; Nor any
    voice of mourning save the choirs, The shrill, demented choirs of wailing
    shells; And bugles calling for them from sad shires. What candles may be
    held to speed them all? Not in the hands of boys, but in their eyes Shall
    shine the holy glimmers of goodbyes. The pallor of girls' brows shall be
    their pall; Their flowers the tenderness of patient minds, And each slow
    dusk a drawing-down of blinds.</p>

  <p>The Six-Day War of 1967 was momentous in that it radically reshaped the
    political architecture of the Middle East, not only through Israel’s sudden
    territorial expansion but by cementing a regional psychology defined by
    radicalization and militarized nationalism among the Arab states, at least
    for a time. The swift defeat of Egypt, Jordan, and Syria undermined pan-Arab
    ideology and catalyzed the rise of political Islam, while Israel's control
    of East Jerusalem, the West Bank, and Gaza sowed the seeds for decades of
    occupation, insurgency, and diplomatic paralysis. The<a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/21/us-strike-iran-nuclear-israel-trump">
      American strike on Iran’s Fordow, Natanz and Isfahan nuclear
      facilities</a>, executed in tandem with Israeli support marks a decisive
    rupture in the shadow war that has long simmered between Jerusalem and
    Tehran. Until recently, hostilities between the two adversaries had unfolded
    in semi-deniable arenas: cyber intrusions, proxy conflicts in Syria and
    Lebanon, and covert sabotage operations targeting nuclear infrastructure.
    The introduction of overt American force into this equation, however,
    represents an unprecedented expansion of the conflict’s geographic and
    political scope. That the United States would engage in a direct strike on
    Iranian soil, signals not merely a tactical escalation but a deliberate
    shift in Washington’s strategic calculus. What was once framed as deterrence
    now flirts openly with the architecture of <em>preventive</em> armed
    conflict.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>While the Six-Day War redrew physical boundaries, the Israeli-Iranian
    conflict threatens to redraw geopolitical alignments, potentially isolating
    Iran further while driving Arab states, ironically, into closer security
    cooperation with Israel. However, both wars share the capacity to escalate
    into broader regional conflagrations with unpredictable consequences. The
    former shaped identity through displacement and triumphalism, the latter
    risks defining a generation through protracted low-intensity warfare,
    economic instability, and the erosion of state sovereignty across multiple
    fronts. Yet, if managed with diplomatic foresight, the Israeli-Iranian War,
    unlike 1967, could also offer a perverse form of realignment, compelling
    regional actors to prioritize stability over ideological enmity.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>This latest<a href="https://pragmaticpapers.github.io/16/israel/">
      conflict</a>, beginning just seven days ago, was precipitated by what
    Israeli intelligence assessed as a critical inflection point in Iran’s
    nuclear programs. Specifically, Tehran’s purported preparation for rapid
    uranium enrichment beyond weapons-grade thresholds at fortified sites such
    as<a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250617005535/https:/www.nytimes.com/2025/06/16/us/politics/iran-nuclear-site-israel.html">
      Fordow</a> and Natanz as well as further attempts at weaponizing nuclear
    material. Israeli officials contend that the window to prevent nuclear
    breakout had effectively closed, necessitating immediate and forceful action
    to degrade Iran’s technical capacity and command-and-control infrastructure.
    The strategic calculus underpinning this decision was shaped not only by the
    perceived imminence of the threat, but also by an evolving environment in
    which regional deterrence had faltered and international diplomatic
    mechanisms were seen as ineffectual or complicit in Iran’s acceleration
    toward threshold nuclear capability.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The question of whether Iran was actively developing a nuclear weapon
    remains central to both the strategic justification for the U.S.-Israeli
    strike and the broader legitimacy of military escalation. While Tehran has
    long insisted its nuclear program is peaceful and primarily civilian in
    nature,<a
      href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/iranian-breakout-timelines-under-jcpoa-type-limits">
      numerous</a> independent assessments indicate that Iran's uranium
    enrichment levels, stockpile size, and centrifuge deployment had approached
    thresholds consistent with nuclear weapons capability. Under the now-defunct
    Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) framework, Iran’s breakout time
    was estimated at over a year; by mid-2025, experts<a
      href="https://isis-online.org/isis-reports/how-quickly-could-iran-make-nuclear-weapons-today?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
      warned</a> it had dwindled to mere months, assuming an intent to divert
    enriched material to weapons-grade uses.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The Fordow facility itself, deeply embedded within a mountain near Qom and
    designed for high-level enrichment, has long been a focal point of Western
    intelligence concern. Its fortification, limited international oversight,
    and use of advanced centrifuges made it uniquely suited to weapons-oriented
    activity, according to recent satellite analysis and leaked assessments. The
    Israeli and American claim that Fordow was being prepared for a rapid
    transition to weapons production is bolstered by Iran’s recent actions:<a
      href="https://www.iaea.org/sites/default/files/25/06/gov2025-38.pdf">
      reducing IAEA cooperation</a>, upgrading centrifuge arrays, and
    restricting access to monitoring data. Although Iran denies these claims,
    its behavior has exhibited a deliberate ambiguity that reinforces suspicions
    and complicates diplomatic engagement.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>Despite repeated Israeli assertions that Iran has definitively restarted
    its nuclear weapons program,<a
      href="https://www.npr.org/2025/06/18/nx-s1-5436758/israel-and-u-s-intelligence-differ-on-status-of-irans-nuclear-program-whos-right">
      the U.S. intelligence community remains unconvinced</a> of such a
    conclusion. In March, Director of National Intelligence Tulsi Gabbard
    explicitly stated that American agencies assess Iran suspended its nuclear
    weapons ambitions in 2003 and that Supreme Leader Khamenei had not
    re‑authorized such a program. Moreover, senior U.S. analysts argue that
    while Iran has substantially enriched uranium, accumulating more than 400 kg
    at nearly 60% purity, there is no evidence indicating a concerted effort to
    weaponize the material. They stress that building a functional bomb still
    requires significant additional steps, including warhead design and
    integration with delivery systems, capabilities that U.S. intelligence says
    Tehran has not formally pursued.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In contrast, Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahu and supporting military
    analysts interpret the same intelligence differently, claiming that Iran has
    moved "very close" to a bomb and is actively weaponizing its enriched
    uranium stockpile. This divergence in interpretation is emblematic of deeper
    strategic fault lines: Washington seeks calibrated assessments to inform
    diplomacy and avoid conflict escalation, while Israel focuses on worst‑case
    framings to justify preemptive military action and rally domestic
    resilience. Such contradictory threat perceptions, framed by each
    government’s political calculus and security doctrines, have tangible
    implications as policymakers weigh military intervention against diplomatic
    avenues going forward.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The<a href="https://www.kan.org.il/content/kan-news/defense/919691/">
      Israeli government has explicitly</a> framed its actions as a necessary
    measure to prevent the Islamic Republic from reaching nuclear breakout
    capability, citing a convergence of intelligence assessments indicating that
    Tehran was on the verge of enriching weapons-grade uranium at multiple
    hardened sites, including Fordow and Natanz. These operations are grounded
    in Israel’s long-standing military doctrine of strategic preemption, most
    notably exemplified in the 1981 strike on Iraq’s Osirak reactor and the 2007
    attack on Syria’s Al-Kibar nuclear facility, actions taken unilaterally, and
    without international approval, to neutralize existential threats before
    they could fully materialize.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Israel and the U.S.’s legal and strategic rationale for the strike campaign
    against Iran rests on a claim of <em>preemptive</em> self-defense grounded
    in both historical precedent and dynamic threat assessment. Drawing
    comparisons to its 1981 airstrike on Iraq’s Osirak nuclear facility, Israeli
    officials have invoked the doctrine of anticipatory action, arguing that
    Iran had crossed critical enrichment thresholds, rendering its nuclear
    program no longer speculative but imminent. The justification hinges on
    classified intelligence assessments reportedly shared with U.S. and European
    counterparts, which indicated that Iran had accelerated centrifuge
    deployment and begun preparations for weaponization pathways previously
    undeclared. While Israel has not formally submitted these findings to
    international bodies, its leadership has characterized the intelligence as
    actionable and time-sensitive, leaving little margin for multilateral
    deliberation.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Intelligence, in this context, operates not only as the evidentiary
    foundation for Israel’s military action but also as a strategic instrument
    of statecraft. Israel has sought to shape both elite and public perceptions
    of the Iranian threat. This information campaign, while opaque in terms of
    sourcing and verification, has effectively framed Iran as a state on the
    cusp of nuclear breakout, with malign intent and a shrinking window for
    deterrence. The reliance on<a
      href="https://warontherocks.com/2025/06/intelligence-strategy-and-the-israeli-iranian-war/">
      intelligence as both trigger and narrative architecture</a> mirrors past
    Israeli doctrine, wherein secrecy, precision, and psychological priming
    precede kinetic engagement.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Yet the burden of credibility in intelligence-led warfare is high,
    particularly in a region marred by prior intelligence failures and
    disinformation campaigns. Unlike the Osirak strike, which occurred in an era
    of limited scrutiny and slower information flow, the current conflict
    unfolds in an environment saturated with real-time analysis, partisan
    interpretation, and algorithmically driven media ecosystems. Israel’s
    claims, while compelling to its allies, remain contested by a range of
    international actors who view the absence of transparent evidence and
    multilateral consensus as undermining the legitimacy of the operation. As a
    result, the war is being fought not only on physical terrain but also in the
    legal and epistemic domains, where truth and legitimacy are all subject to
    contestation.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>From the standpoint of international law, Israel and the U.S.’s position
    occupies a legally contentious space, situated at the fault line between
    Article 51 of the UN Charter and customary norms of sovereignty. Proponents
    of the strike<a
      href="https://lieber.westpoint.edu/assessing-legality-israels-action-iran-international-law/">
      argue</a> that the existential threat posed by a nuclear-capable Iran
    justifies unilateral defensive measures, especially given the apparent
    erosion of the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA) and the
    International Atomic Energy Agency's findings that Iran was in breach of its
    obligations under the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty. Critics, however,<a
      href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/20/are-israels-attacks-against-iran-legal">
      point</a> to the absence of a clear, imminent armed attack by Iran and
    argue that preemptive force without Security Council authorization
    contravenes core principles of non-aggression. This interpretive divide
    underscores a broader legal ambiguity in the global security architecture,
    where normative rules often lag behind emerging threats and asymmetries of
    power.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Under American law, the president’s authority to launch a strike against
    Iran, absent congressional authorization, rests on a contested
    interpretation of executive war powers, particularly as framed by the 1973
    War Powers Resolution and Article II of the U.S. Constitution. While the
    executive branch has long claimed that the president may order limited
    military action to protect national interests without prior approval from
    Congress, critics argue that such unilateral action stretches constitutional
    intent and undermines legislative war powers. The Trump administration
    justified previous strikes on Iranian targets, such as the 2020 killing of
    Qassem Soleimani, on the basis of both inherent self-defense powers and the
    2002 Authorization for Use of Military Force (AUMF) against Iraq, an
    interpretation widely challenged as a distortion of congressional mandate.
    The ambiguity arises from decades of presidential precedent, during which
    successive administrations have expanded executive authority in the domain
    of foreign military engagement, often with post hoc rationalizations rather
    than clear statutory support. Consequently, any strike on Iran without
    explicit congressional support, while<a
      href="https://www.cfr.org/expert-brief/does-trump-have-authority-strike-iran">
      fraught, is likely illegal</a>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>According to sources within the Israeli defense establishment as well as<a
      href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/iran-update-special-report-june-20-2025-evening-edition">
      open source tracking</a>, Israeli strikes have targeted a constellation of
    facilities central to Iran’s nuclear weapons infrastructure, as well as key
    Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corp (IRGC) command-and-control nodes. Satellite
    imagery and post-battle damage assessments indicate that Israeli fighter
    aircraft conducted precision strikes on underground bunkers, suspected
    centrifuge halls, and hardened radar-protected compounds. In conjunction
    with these kinetic operations, Israeli commando units and electronic warfare
    teams reportedly launched coordinated suppression missions to degrade
    Iranian air defense networks during the initial wave of attacks, further
    underscoring the multidomain character of this operation. The IDF has
    described these strikes as both "surgical" and "decisive," designed not
    merely to delay Iran's program but to permanently dismantle its capacity to
    weaponize fissile material.</p>

      Daily Mail</a></p>
  <p>Strategically, the operation appears calibrated not only to blunt Iran’s
    nuclear timeline but also to signal Israeli resolve in an era of diminishing
    U.S. deterrence and increasing regional instability. By striking deep into
    Iranian territory, Israel is reaffirming its strategic autonomy and
    willingness to act unilaterally when core national interests, specifically
    the preservation of its nuclear monopoly, are perceived to be at risk.
    Simultaneously, the political messaging emerging from the Prime Minister’s
    office is calibrated for both domestic and international audiences:
    domestically, to project strength and deter political rivals;
    internationally, to frame the operation as a necessary act of self-defense
    under Article 51 of the U.N. Charter, despite the lack of multilateral
    endorsement. This dual-level signaling reveals the complex interplay between
    realpolitik, national security imperatives, and international norms that now
    define Israel’s strategic posture vis-à-vis the Iranian threat.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Furthermore, the scope and ambition of Israel’s current military campaign
    suggest a long-term reconsideration of its deterrence doctrine, expanding
    beyond reactive defense to encompass sustained degradation of adversarial
    infrastructure deep within hostile territory. By targeting not only known
    enrichment facilities but also missile production sites, IRGC logistical
    hubs, and research installations suspected of dual-use capabilities, the IDF
    is executing a broad-spectrum offensive intended to collapse Iran’s
    integrated warfighting and strategic development architecture. This approach
    reflects a recognition within Israeli strategic circles that the Iranian
    threat is not merely a nuclear one, but a systemic challenge involving
    conventional force projection, regional proxy warfare, and asymmetric
    retaliation. The breadth of the strikes, coordinated with real-time
    intelligence, deep surveillance assets, and advanced electronic warfare
    platforms, also highlights the operational maturity of Israeli strategic
    planning, which now embraces simultaneity and multidimensional pressure as
    core tenets of its regional security paradigm.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In the wake of Israel’s deep-penetration strikes against key Iranian
    nuclear and military infrastructure, the<a
      href="https://en.mehrnews.com/live/233375/Iran-launches-another-barrage-of-missiles-on-Israel">
      Islamic Republic has responded</a> with forceful barrages of ballistic
    missile and drone attacks. Tehran’s decision to retaliate openly, rather
    than through proxies or cyber channels, represents a significant escalation
    in both strategic signaling and doctrinal posture. No longer confined to
    asymmetric reprisal or plausible deniability, Iran is asserting its capacity
    to retaliate against a regional nuclear adversary with direct, state-level
    force.</p>

  <p>The missile strikes have seemingly attempted to target a mixture of
    military installations, including air bases, logistics hubs, radar sites,
    <em>and</em> civilian infrastructure within Israeli urban centers. This
    bifurcated targeting strategy appears to serve both tactical and
    psychological objectives. On one hand, it aims to degrade Israel’s
    operational capacity to launch sustained aerial campaigns; on the other, it
    seeks<a
      href="https://www.javanonline.ir/fa/news/1303490/%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B4-%D8%B1%DA%98%DB%8C%D9%85%E2%80%8C%D8%B5%D9%87%DB%8C%D9%88%D9%86%DB%8C%D8%B3%D8%AA%DB%8C-%D8%A8%D8%A7-%D8%AC%D9%86%DA%AF-%D9%81%D8%B1%D8%B3%D8%A7%DB%8C%D8%B4%DB%8C%C2%A0">
      to induce public anxiety, political pressure, and symbolic parity</a> by
    demonstrating that Iranian missile systems can penetrate Israel’s
    multi-layered missile defense architecture. While the Arrow and David’s
    Sling systems have reportedly intercepted a substantial portion of incoming
    projectiles, the saturation effect and adaptive trajectory programming of
    Iranian ordnance have exposed vulnerabilities in Israeli air defense
    doctrine.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>However, Iran’s missile salvos against Israel have starkly illuminated the
    intrinsic limitations of its strategic bombardment doctrine, which hinges on
    saturation rather than precision. According to<a
      href="https://missilematters.substack.com/p/missiles-in-the-air-tensions-everywhere">
      some observers of the October 2024</a> strikes, Iran purportedly targeted
    Israeli military and intelligence sites, yet hit rates remained dismally
    low, underscoring a mismatch between ambition and technical execution.<a
      href="https://www.iiss.org/online-analysis/online-analysis/2025/06/israels-attack-and-the-limits-of-irans-missile-strategy/">
      The Institute for International Strategic Studies</a> further critiques
    Tehran’s reliance on medium-range ballistic missiles, noting that during the
    2024 campaign, these systems “demonstrated limited accuracy, restricting
    their value in counterforce roles” which may explain Iran’s possible
    decision to switch to counter-value targeting. Consequently, despite the
    volume of weapons launched, the cumulative strategic effect is diluted by
    systemic inaccuracy, leaving Iran’s coercive intent undermined by palpable
    imprecision.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Tehran’s information apparatus has simultaneously weaponized<a
      href="https://en.mehrnews.com/news/233392/Suprises-of-Iran-Armed-Forces-to-bring-Israel-to-its-knees">
      the narrative of resistance</a>, positioning the strikes as both defensive
    necessity and moral obligation. Statements from senior IRGC commanders,
    amplified by state-aligned media outlets characterize the missile operations
    as calculated punishment and a step toward strategic deterrence equilibrium.
    This rhetorical framing is not merely propagandistic; it reflects Iran’s
    larger ambition to redefine the rules of regional engagement. By abandoning
    proxy intermediaries in favor of direct sovereign action, Iran appears to be
    claiming a kind of strategic adulthood, staking its place as a peer
    competitor to Israel, rather than a subordinate actor reliant on asymmetry.
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Still, the<a
      href="https://www.csis.org/analysis/irans-options-retaliating-against-israel">
      risks associated with this posture are profound</a>. Iran’s cities, while
    equipped with some level of air defense, remain highly vulnerable to
    retaliatory air strikes, particularly on command infrastructure, industrial
    zones, and power grids. Moreover, Tehran’s decision to escalate through
    overt ballistic missile use has activated a wider set of regional alarm
    bells, particularly in Gulf states. The intersection of technological
    capability and political will in Tehran now places the Islamic Republic on
    the threshold of conventional warfare escalation, a domain in which it has
    little operational experience against a peer adversary like Israel. As Iran
    asserts its deterrent power through missiles rather than diplomacy, the
    conflict narrative inches perilously closer to a mutually reinforcing cycle
    of provocation and reprisal with uncertain thresholds.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The human cost of the Israel-Iran conflict is rapidly accumulating on both
    sides, underscoring the multidimensional nature of contemporary warfare.
    In<a
      href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/devastation-grows-as-iran-targets-civilian-areas-despite-interceptors-and-shelters/">
      Israel</a>, waves of Iranian ballistic missile attacks have seemingly
    stretched even the country’s sophisticated layered air defense systems, with
    David’s Sling and Arrow intercepting a significant, but not exhaustive,
    volume of incoming fire. Despite these technological safeguards, strikes on
    urban centers such as Tel Aviv, Haifa, and Ashdod have resulted in civilian
    casualties, infrastructural damage, and widespread psychological trauma.
    Hospitals have activated mass casualty protocols, while schools and public
    services across central Israel remain shuttered indefinitely. The specter of
    a prolonged air campaign has introduced a new mode of public vulnerability
    not witnessed since the Gulf War.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>On the Iranian side, Israeli airstrikes have targeted high-value military
    and infrastructural sites with precision, leveraging satellite intelligence
    and real-time signals intercepts to cripple air defense batteries, IRGC
    command nodes, and suspected nuclear enrichment facilities. However, the
    relentless Israeli air campaign, which has pulverized crucial military and
    nuclear infrastructure in Tehran, has also precipitated<a
      href="https://www.nbcnews.com/world/middle-east/tehran-residents-israel-iran-bombing-rcna213955">
      mass displacement</a>, critically impaired essential services, and induced
    pervasive<a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/iranians-tehran-israel-fear-evacuation-9f65e7cd976ad2feb94e5be2eb973be6">
      psychological distress</a>, particularly among those trapped without
    reliable shelter or communication amid intermittent internet blackouts. Even
    as the strikes claim dozens of lives and inflict widespread structural
    damage, many Iranian civilians, though vocally critical of both their
    government and external intervention, are left immobilized by fear,
    logistical obstacles, and fracturing social cohesion, underscoring the
    devastating human toll of urban bombardment in modern warfare .</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Strategically, the mutual infliction of damage marks a departure from
    previous cycles of retaliation and escalation, wherein both actors operated
    largely in the dark. This conflict, however, has pierced the veil of
    deniability, and in doing so has fundamentally restructured the calculus of
    deterrence. The Israeli air campaign, measured and surgical though it may
    be, is premised on the assumption that strategic pain will induce Iranian
    restraint; yet Iran’s targeting of Israeli civilian areas calls this
    assumption into question. More perilously, both nations now face the
    destabilizing feedback loop of demonstrating resolve while avoiding
    existential miscalculation. If neither side is willing to absorb damage
    without escalating in turn, the conflict risks evolving into a prolonged war
    of attrition with no clear threshold for de-escalation.</p>

  <p>American involvement, long discussed in speculative terms, became a matter
    of fact when U.S. bombers struck Iran’s nuclear facilities. Per<a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/21/politics/video/trump-iran-strikes-remarks-digvid">
      statements from the White House</a>, the strike was coordinated in
    conjunction with Israeli operations and carried out with the express aim of
    crippling Iran’s nuclear program infrastructure. The attack constitutes the
    first time in decades that the United States has conducted a kinetic
    operation on sovereign Iranian soil, a move that signals both the scale of
    Washington’s commitment and the seriousness with which it regards Tehran’s
    nuclear trajectory. This escalation, however, risks broadening the conflict
    into a region-wide conflagration.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The United States now finds itself navigating a complex and precarious
    position in the unfolding Israel-Iran conflict, oscillating between its
    longstanding alliance with Israel, its desire to prevent a broader regional
    conflagration, and its imperative to manage great-power rivalries. Publicly,
    the White House has characterized its support for Israel as unshakeable,
    emphasizing the strategic necessity of preventing Iran’s nuclear breakout.
    Behind closed doors, however, some<a
      href="https://responsiblestatecraft.org/tulsi-iran-bomb/"> senior
      administration officials</a> reportedly harbor concerns about escalation
    spiraling beyond control, particularly if Israeli and American strikes force
    Iran to activate its proxy network in Yemen or Iraq or attempt to close
    maritime chokepoints such as the Strait of Hormuz. U.S. intelligence
    assistance, cyber coordination, and mid-air refueling capabilities suggest a
    level of embeddedness in Israeli operations that approaches de facto
    co-belligerency.</p>

    <span class="caption">Image 4</span>
  </div>
  <p>This posture reflects both tactical calculation and political constraint.
    On the one hand, U.S. officials recognize that strategic inaction could
    embolden Iran, weaken Israeli deterrence, and fracture existing regional
    security architectures, especially those forged under the Abraham Accords.
    On the other, the prospect of being drawn into another protracted Middle
    Eastern war sits uneasily with both<a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/06/19/israel-iran-war-americans-poll">
      the public</a> and many members of Congress, some of whom have questioned
    the wisdom of entrusting a conflict with nuclear overtones to bilateral
    escalation dynamics. Congressional briefings have revealed stark divisions,
    with hawkish voices calling for punitive strikes against Iranian missile
    factories and more dovish factions advocating for multilateral diplomacy via
    the United Nations or European interlocutors. Thus, the administration’s
    balancing act is not merely operational but existential: it must
    simultaneously project strength, manage escalation, and safeguard American
    strategic interests without escalating a war it cannot contain.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Notwithstanding, the Trump administration’s expedition into Iranian
    airspace has provoked a crescendo of warnings from Tehran. Iranian Foreign
    Minister Abbas Araghchi ominously warned that<a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/06/19/middle-east-us-bases-iran-strikes-trump/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
      every American military site and citizen</a> would henceforth be deemed
    lawful targets, a message reiterated in official state media across varied
    channels. The Pentagon’s<a
      href="https://thehill.com/policy/defense/5361526-us-troops-iran-middle-east/">
      defensive posture</a>, evidenced by the deployment of additional aircraft
    carriers, destroyers, F‑16s stationed in Saudi Arabia, missile-defense
    systems at al‑Udeid and al‑Asad airbases, and the evacuation of embassy
    dependents, starkly underscores an acute awareness of the looming threat.
    Although Iran’s long-range missile cache was degraded by Israeli strikes,
    its arsenal of short-range rockets and Iraqi proxies remains potent enough
    to inflict substantial damage on forward-deployed U.S. personnel and
    infrastructure.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Iran stands at a crossroad of strategic<a
      href="https://www.politico.com/news/magazine/2025/06/18/us-attacks-iran-expert-predictions-analysis-00413901">
      choices</a>: it can initiate a limited missile-and-drone barrage on
    American bases, orchestrate proxy assaults or disrupt global energy flows by
    mining or threatening the Strait of Hormuz, each option laden with its own
    strategic payoff and peril. Historically, Tehran has calibrated its
    response: after the 2020 killing of Qassem Soleimani, Iran struck U.S. bases
    in Iraq with ballistic missiles, causing hundreds of traumatic brain
    injuries but stopping short of inflicting fatalities, a measured strike
    aimed at psychological impact without triggering full-scale war. Yet the
    consensus among defense experts is that any Iranian assault, whether kinetic
    or via malign cyberattacks, would likely yield a disproportionately
    aggressive American counter-response, prompting regional escalation or even
    enlargement of the conflict into theater-wide warfare .</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Destabilization of global energy markets adds another pernicious dimension.
    Iran’s capacity to lash out in the Strait of Hormuz risks precipitating a
    spike in oil prices, a potential crucible of economic vulnerability for the
    U.S. and its allies, but it would also inflict significant collateral
    economic harm upon Iran, inviting sweeping multilateral reprisals.
    Concurrently, the<a
      href="https://taskandpurpose.com/news/us-forces-middle-east-buildup/">
      United States has shored up</a> air defense, naval presence, and forward
    deployments not merely to blunt an imminent strike, but to project
    deterrence signaling that any Iranian action against American assets would
    be met with decisive force. As such, although material damage to U.S.
    outposts remains likely in the near term, the fundamental question is
    whether Tehran retries calibrated reprisal to assert resistance or refrains
    in deference to the gravest threat it now faces, an inexorable American
    rollback against its ambitions in the region.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>For Iran, the perception of U.S. complicity in Israeli aggression functions
    as both a mobilizing narrative and a strategic redline. Iranian state media
    has repeatedly invoked the specter of “Anglo-Zionist aggression,” conflating
    U.S. logistical support with moral culpability. High-ranking IRGC officials
    have<a
      href="https://www.javanonline.ir/fa/news/1303493/%D8%AF%D8%B1%D8%B5%D9%88%D8%B1%D8%AA-%D8%AD%D9%85%D9%84%D9%87-%D8%A2%D9%85%D8%B1%DB%8C%DA%A9%D8%A7-%D8%AA%D9%84%D8%A7%D9%81%DB%8C-%D9%85%DB%8C-%DA%A9%D9%86%DB%8C%D9%85">
      explicitly threatened retaliation</a> against American regional assets,
    including military installations in Iraq, Syria, and the Gulf states, should
    the U.S. cross what Tehran defines as the threshold of active participation.
    These warnings are not merely rhetorical. In April 2025, prior to the
    outbreak of open hostilities, Iranian-backed militias in Iraq increased
    drone activity near U.S. bases, suggesting a well-prepared escalation
    ladder. The risk calculus, then, hinges on whether Iran believes U.S.
    involvement has already reached that threshold, and whether Washington is
    prepared to absorb and respond to retaliatory strikes without opening an
    irreversible regional front.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>In this sense, the U.S. is less a detached observer and more a latent
    protagonist, enmeshed in the conflict’s escalation dynamics whether it
    wishes to be or not. Its military footprint, intelligence-sharing
    arrangements, and declarative posture bind it to Israel’s strategic
    trajectory, while also exposing American interests to asymmetric retaliation
    across the region. The Trump administration’s ability to simultaneously
    deter Iranian adventurism, restrain Israeli overreach, and assure Arab
    partners of its stability commitment constitutes a near-impossible trifecta.
    Should any of these elements falter, the conflict risks metastasizing beyond
    its current parameters, pulling the U.S. into a war not by design but by
    gravitational inevitability. In this light, America’s role is not simply to
    support or restrain, it is to shape the very logic of escalation itself.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>While Israel and Iran exchange direct military blows, the Arab states find
    themselves caught in a precarious balancing act, between pragmatic
    geopolitical alignments and deep-seated historical sensitivities. The
    Abraham Accords, once hailed as a transformative breakthrough in
    Arab-Israeli normalization, now confront their most formidable stress test
    since inception. States such as the United Arab Emirates and Bahrain, while
    officially aligned with Israel in economic and technological domains, have
    issued cautious statements that reflect a reluctance to be seen as complicit
    in what is widely viewed in Arab public opinion as an aggressive escalation
    by Tel Aviv. Meanwhile, Saudi Arabia’s posture remains deliberately opaque,
    signaling both an unwillingness to fracture its tentative outreach to Israel
    and an acute awareness of domestic and regional backlash were it to appear
    overly sympathetic to Israeli strategic objectives. This diplomatic hedging
    underscores the structural fragility of regional alliances built more on
    shared enmity toward Iran than on any resolved ideological or territorial
    concord with Israel.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Concurrently, Iran’s axis of resistance, comprising Hezbollah, Hamas and
    numerous Shi’a militias across Iraq and Yemen, has<a
      href="https://www.understandingwar.org/backgrounder/deafening-silence-iran%E2%80%99s-proxies">
      responded with a silence</a> that is as notable as it is revealing. The
    absence of a coordinated, multi-front eruption from Iran’s regional network
    suggests either an unwillingness to intervene, or more likely an inability.
    Nearly two years of war have likely dented Hezbollah’s stockpiles of rockets
    and missiles while previous Israeli strikes have greatly weakened the
    group’s organizational structure. Hamas on the other hand has been rendered
    nearly completely impotent, confined to underground tunnels in Gaza.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The psychological and strategic implications of Iran obtaining a nuclear
    weapon would be profound, not only for Israel but for the broader Middle
    East. For Israel, a nuclear-armed Iran represents an existential threat that
    fundamentally undermines the doctrine of unilateral deterrence upon which
    much of its defense policy has historically depended. Regionally, a
    successful Iranian nuclear test, or even a confirmed weapons-capable
    threshold, could trigger a destabilizing cascade of proliferation: Saudi
    Arabia, Turkey, and Egypt have all alluded to revisiting their nuclear
    postures in the event of Iranian success. Such a development would unravel
    decades of nonproliferation diplomacy and introduce new dimensions of
    instability into an already volatile strategic landscape. Moreover, it would
    embolden Tehran's regional proxy network, fundamentally altering the
    deterrence calculus for the U.S., NATO, and Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC)
    states.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Adding to the gravity of the moment are<a
      href="https://thebulletin.org/2024/02/wargame-simulated-a-conflict-between-israel-and-iran-it-quickly-went-nuclear/">
      previously conducted wargames</a>, such as the Bulletin of the Atomic
    Scientists’ 2024 simulation, which forecasted that a conventional war
    between Israel and Iran could escalate to nuclear use within mere days under
    certain strategic conditions. These simulations underscore how fragile the
    ladder of escalation truly is when both adversaries perceive existential
    stakes and operate within compressed decision cycles. With Iran’s
    command-and-control potentially decentralized under duress and Israel
    operating under a doctrine of preemptive clarity, the risk of miscalculation
    or overreaction is not merely theoretical but structurally embedded.
    Furthermore, Israel’s longstanding opacity regarding its own nuclear arsenal
    complicates international efforts to impose symmetry or mutual restraint,
    deepening the fog of deterrence rather than dispelling it.</p>

  <p> </p>
  <p>The present conflict thus operates in the shadow of nuclear ambiguity,
    where the weapon in question need not be detonated to shape behavior, it
    need only be believed to exist. Iran’s potential acquisition of a nuclear
    weapon would represent not just a material escalation, but a profound
    symbolic inversion of the regional power balance. In response, the strategic
    doctrine of containment, so often invoked during the Cold War, may prove
    inadequate against an ideologically driven state with both transnational
    proxies and an active missile program. Consequently, the implications of
    Iran's nuclear trajectory cannot be confined to the Israeli-Iranian dyad;
    they radiate outward into every corridor of global security architecture,
    demanding a recalibration not only of regional deterrence theory but of the
    credibility and adaptability of the global nonproliferation regime itself.
  </p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>As the Israel-Iran conflict accelerates into its second week, the
    diplomatic vacuum surrounding it grows more conspicuous and ominous. The
    United Nations Security Council remains paralyzed, mired in geopolitical
    fragmentation, with vetoes and abstentions stalling substantive resolutions.
    European capitals, while condemning Iran’s missile barrages and urging
    restraint from Israel,<a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/europeans-try-coax-iran-back-diplomacy-trump-considers-strikes-2025-06-20/">
      appear strategically impotent</a>, reduced to issuing statements devoid of
    coercive leverage. The United States, though ostensibly seeking
    de-escalation, is entangled in a contradictory posture: providing
    operational intelligence to Israel while simultaneously signaling openness
    to mediation. Russia and China, for their part, have opportunistically
    leveraged the crisis to critique American unilateralism, while<a
      href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/19/putin-xi-criticise-israels-attacks-on-iran-urge-de-escalation">
      offering vague support</a> to Iran under the guise of defending regional
    sovereignty. In effect, the prevailing diplomatic climate resembles an echo
    chamber of managed concern, loud, repetitive, and ineffectual.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Endgame scenarios remain speculative, but none are promising. A prolonged
    war of attrition risks dragging the region into a broader conflagration,
    with non-state actors like Hezbollah and Iranian-backed militias in Iraq
    potentially mobilizing in response to Israeli or American escalations.
    Conversely, a negotiated ceasefire without meaningful guarantees on nuclear
    constraints or missile deactivation would be interpreted by both parties as
    a tactical pause rather than strategic resolution, merely resetting the
    countdown to the next kinetic phase. The absence of a viable conflict
    termination framework, combined with maximalist objectives on both sides,
    suggests that traditional diplomacy is unlikely to suffice. If the war does
    not culminate in outright regime collapse, nuclear breakout, or the reversal
    of Iran’s nuclear weapon ambitions, it may instead ossify into a new
    regional equilibrium, violent, fragile, and governed by fear rather than
    formal agreements.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The eruption of direct military hostilities between the U.S., Israel and
    Iran signals a profound transformation in the architecture of Middle Eastern
    security, displacing decades of covert confrontation with overt and
    sustained armed conflict. What had previously been a theater of deniable
    cyberattacks, proxy wars, and intelligence operations has metastasized into
    an escalatory cycle of missile strikes and preemptive aerial campaigns. This
    transition marks not only the collapse of strategic ambiguity but the
    erosion of the diplomatic buffer zones that once kept Tehran and Jerusalem
    from crossing the threshold into full-scale war. The implications
    reverberate far beyond the battlefield, challenging the foundations of
    regional deterrence and exposing the limitations of existing multilateral
    frameworks for conflict containment.</p>

      Group)</a></p>
  <p>The unfolding confrontation between the United States and Iran raises
    profound questions about the limits of military escalation and the elusive
    search for a sustainable strategic equilibrium in the Middle East. By
    striking Iranian nuclear facilities, an act with clear kinetic consequences
    but opaque long-term objectives, Washington may have committed itself to a
    trajectory of confrontation without a credible exit strategy. While
    proponents of deterrence argue that such action forestalls Iranian breakout
    capabilities, the fundamental risk remains that Iran will interpret these
    attacks not as a red line enforcement but as an invitation to escalate
    asymmetrically across the region. In such a context, the logic of
    containment morphs into the logic of perpetual reaction, with each
    retaliatory gesture drawing the United States deeper into a conflict whose
    boundaries and aims are increasingly undefined.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Moreover, the precedent set by this intervention poses a structural problem
    for the broader international system. If the U.S. can justify unilateral
    military action against a sovereign state on the basis of opaque
    intelligence assessments and loosely interpreted self-defense doctrine, it
    weakens the norms of non-aggression that underpin global diplomatic
    architecture. Iran’s nuclear ambitions, while deeply concerning, exist
    within a broader framework of strategic deterrence and regional posturing
    that has, until now, been managed primarily through indirect means. By
    abandoning the slow and often frustrating work of diplomacy in favor of
    targeted strikes, the United States signals to both allies and adversaries
    that the use of force remains not only thinkable but preferable. This
    recalibration of strategic priorities risks undermining the very
    international stability it claims to defend.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>The central question confronting policymakers is not simply whether the
    strikes will “work,” but what constitutes success in a conflict that defies
    resolution through conventional means. If Iran retaliates and the cycle of
    provocation and reprisal deepens, will Washington be prepared for a
    prolonged confrontation, or will it retreat into strategic ambiguity once
    the initial show of force has run its course? The administration’s refusal
    to clearly define its objectives, regime containment, nuclear deterrence,
    regional rebalancing, invites the very instability it seeks to avoid. As
    with previous American interventions in the region, the danger lies not in
    the absence of military capability, but in the absence of strategic clarity.
    Without a clearly articulated endgame, the line between limited engagement
    and open-ended war becomes perilously thin.</p>
