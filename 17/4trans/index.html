  <p>In one of its most landmark decisions in recent history, the Supreme Court
    voted to uphold Tennessee Senate Bill 1 — a bill that effectively bans
    puberty blockers and hormone therapy from being used to treat gender
    dysphoria in minors. Transgender issues have been front and center in the
    American political arena; whether it be issues of involvement in collegiate
    sports, acceptable bathroom usage, or even draconian military service bans,
    pundits spend a large amount of time arguing about the virtues of expanding
    our understanding of gender and sexuality. In United States v. Skremetti,
    the Supreme Court took a decisive stand on one of these issues: what is the
    suspect classification of transgender individuals in the United States?
    While this issue does not get the spotlight on Fox News that transgender
    swimmers do, I would argue that this question affects transgender Americans
    much more consequently than any other issue.</p>
  <p>By siding with the state of Tennessee in barring gender-affirming care from
    minors with gender dysphoria, the Supreme Court rejects the status of
    transgender individuals as being a suspect class, effectively making any
    future argument regarding 14th Amendment equal protection rights much more
    difficult. In a political environment dominated by right-wing conservatism
    and transphobia, the Supreme Court has stranded transgender Americans in a
    legal status of limbo.</p>
  <p>This deep dive into the opinions, backgrounds, and rationales behind this
    landmark SCOTUS decision will develop a case regarding how politically
    right-wing arguments regarding transgender healthcare have found their ways
    onto the bench of the Supreme Court; how by choosing not to answer what the
    legal status of transgender Americans is, the Supreme Court has green-lit
    further discrimination and prejudice; and how the future of judicial
    activism in general looks especially grim.</p>
  <p>In a moment that echoes the failures of the court’s past, Robert's court is
    setting us further back in our fight for gender equality.</p>
  <p><strong>The Case At Hand</strong></p>
  <p>United States v. Skrmetti strikes at the heart of the “gender-affirming
    care for minors” debate. This specific instance can be traced back to March
    of 2023, when the Tennessee House of Representatives passed a bill which
    prohibited the use of medical treatments on minors for gender dysphoria. The
    Tennessee Senate shortly after passed bill SB1, which reinforced the ban —
    this bill was met with scorn from numerous medical professional
    associations, as well as the Biden Department of Justice who issued an
    injunction in the District Court of the Middle District of Tennessee to stop
    this bill from going through. Soon after, a handful of transgender
    teenagers, along with their families and a doctor sued the state of
    Tennessee for violating the Equal Protections Clause.</p>
  <p>The case had a brief stint in the US Court of Appeals for the Sixth
    Circuit, where the major point of contention remained to be the violation of
    the Fourteenth Amendment’s Equal Protection Clause, arguing that the bill
    very formally discriminates based on the gender status of the plaintiffs
    involved. By fully developing and understanding the role that the 14th
    Amendment plays in this case, we can further theorize as to how this case
    will affect the plight of transgender rights in the future.</p>
  <p><strong>Equal Protection</strong></p>
  <p>The Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment is one of the most
    consequential clauses in the Constitution. It guarantees that no state can
    deny a person equal protection under the law, effectively banning any form
    of discrimination on an inherent quality. The Equal Protection Clause was a
    key factor in ending segregation, legalizing gay-marriage, and strengthening
    the ability for our institutions to uphold our fundamental rights; the
    consequences of Brown v. Board of Education can be found in every legal
    avenue where discrimination, prejudice, and other forms of oppression take
    form.</p>
  <p>With regards to the Supreme Court’s decision this week, the government
    argued that SB1 violated the Equal Protections Clause by discriminating on
    the basis of sex. The government was able to argue on this point because the
    bill does not unilaterally ban the use of hormone therapy and
    gender-affirming care to minors in Tennessee. Rather, it bans the use only
    in the case where the patient suffers from gender dysphoria; if a minor in
    Tennessee had another type of disorder where use of hormone therapy is
    recommended, they may seek that in the state of Tennessee. The government
    argues that this distinction inherently rests on the basis of “sex,” and
    therefore a heightened level of scrutiny is warranted. Tennessee states that
    the claim that the bill discriminates on the basis of sex is unfounded,
    arguing that the bill only disallows a very specific medical procedure.</p>
  <p>But in taking that an individual that suffers from gender dysphoria and
    requires hormone therapy (as recommended by the vast majority of medical
    professional associations) is recognized under a certain group, does that
    not maintain that the level of discrimination here isn’t on “sex,” but on
    “gender identity?” And if SB1 does discriminate based on “gender identity”
    should a level of intermediate scrutiny not be placed on this case?</p>
  <p>While the Supreme Court sides with Tennessee in their insinuation that SB1
    does not violate the Equal Protections Clause because it discriminates based
    on some form of “gender identity” and not sex, precedence shows that the
    Supreme Court does not view the two any separately. Look no further than
    Bostock v. Clayton County (2020), which effectively made gender identity a
    protected class.</p>
  <p><strong>Bostock v. Clayton County</strong></p>
  <p>In one of SCOTUS’ most consequential cases regarding LGBT rights in recent
    history, Justice Neil Gorsuch delivered an opinion that protected employees
    from being discriminated against on the basis of their sexual orientation or
    gender identity. Up until then, Title VII did not cover discrimination based
    on sexual orientation, meaning that gay, lesbian, and transgender workers
    were not constitutionally protected from workplace discrimination. This case
    effectively meant that discrimination-based issues related to sexual
    orientation or gender identity would trigger “intermediate scrutiny,”
    placing it on the same level as discrimination based on sex.</p>
  <p>In his majority opinion, Justice Gorsuch argued that discrimination based
    on sexual orientation or gender identity is also discrimination “because of
    sex,” directly placing it under the Title VII umbrella. Gorsuch writes:</p>
  <p><em>“An employer who fires an individual for being homosexual or
      transgender fires that person for traits or actions it would not have
      questioned in members of a different sex. Sex plays a necessary and
      undisguisable role in the decision, exactly what Title VII forbids. Those
      who adopted the Civil Rights Act might not have anticipated their work
      would lead to this particular result. But the limits of the drafters'
      imagination supply no reason to ignore the law's demands. Only the written
      word is the law, and all persons are entitled to its benefit.”</em></p>
  <p>One has to seriously wonder what happened in the five years between this
    being written and Gorsuch’s vote alongside other conservative members of the
    court in their decision in Skrmetti. It is quite obvious that SB1’s key
    discrimination can be found in the reason behind seeking hormone therapy.
    SB1 clearly states that minors cannot seek these types of treatments if
    their reasoning for doing so is “gender dysphoria,” a very real and serious
    condition that thousands of teenagers face every year.</p>
  <p>If it pleases the court to act like the key issue in Tennessee’s bill is
    not “gender identity,” then they should feel free to do so. But it clearly
    goes against recent precedent that gender identity is in fact a protected
    class and that any allegation of discrimination wherein must trigger
    intermediate scrutiny. The court found that in this case, where the law
    essentially discriminates against individuals who fall in the “gender
    identity” bucket, those who seek equal protection may not find it here.</p>
  <p>The issue with this is that it sets the precedent for “facial neutrality,”
    or writing bills in ways that on paper, do not discriminate on a protected
    class status, but in action most certainly do. The written text in SB1 does
    not outwardly say that transgender teenagers are barred from getting hormone
    therapy; the written text in SB1 applies a parallel ban on a sufficient
    quality that one must have in order to be included in the “gender identity”
    bucket. SB1 gets as close to the line of discrimination on the basis of
    gender identity as possible without crossing that line.</p>
  <p>By siding with Tennessee, the Supreme Court has signaled to the rest of the
    country that laws can discriminate against transgender individuals, as long
    as they do so without outwardly stating so. This means that if you word your
    discrimination well-enough, you can get away with withholding
    gender-affirming care, or rejecting women from healthcare initiatives, or
    even hiring off of the basis of race. While these issues should, in theory,
    be found unconstitutional under the Equal Protections Clause, they manage to
    skirt the regulations meant to restrain them.</p>
  <p><strong>Thomas and the “Medical Consensus”</strong></p>
  <p>Justice Clarence Thomas is considered to be one of, if not the most,
    conservative Supreme Court justices in American history. Justice Thomas has
    led the charge to overturn Roe v. Wade, hand more legislative powers to the
    President, and strike down any attempts to pass common-sense gun control.
    While Thomas says that his beliefs stem from a genuine place of traditional
    jurisprudential philosophy, it has become increasingly clear that Thomas
    takes into account and acts out of his own personal conservative social
    value system. In his concurring opinion on Skrmetti, he chooses not to focus
    on the suspect status of transgender individuals. He does not focus on the
    lack of due process that parents of transgender Tennesseans are afforded
    once the state legislature decides that a certain type of treatment is
    illegal. Thomas instead chooses to repeat often-debunked and disproven
    Republican-driven talking points about the “safety” of transgender care,
    even going so far as to directly contradict doctors he himself considers
    experts.</p>
  <p>In his concurring opinion, Thomas writes:</p>
  <p><em>“Many prominent medical professionals have declared a consensus around
      the efficacy of treating children’s gender dysphoria with puberty
      blockers, cross-sex hormones, and surgical interventions, despite mounting
      evidence to the contrary. They have dismissed grave problems undercutting
      the assumption that young children can consent to irreversible treatments
      that may deprive them of their ability to eventually produce children of
      their own. They have built their medical determinations on concededly weak
      evidence. And, they have surreptitiously compromised their medical
      recommendations to achieve political ends.”</em></p>
  <p>If you were to read this quote alone, you would expect this to be written
    by perhaps the governor of Tennessee or a freshman Freedom Caucus member of
    the House. You do not expect to see this type of rhetoric from a Supreme
    Court judge who decides on cases on the basis of their constitutionality and
    adherence to precedent. To say that he is overstepping his role, however, is
    not the only issue with Thomas’ opinion. It is also factually wrong.</p>
  <p>Thomas does not explain what “mounting evidence” there is to the contrary.
    In the decades-long research expeditions taken on by unbiased and impartial
    medical organizations, it is safe to say that they have done their due
    diligence in order to discover the best methods for treating gender
    dysphoria. They are very explicit when they assert that these methods of
    treatment must be treated with the utmost care and prospects for these forms
    of therapy are heavily screened and made to go through numerous hoops.
    Thomas operates off of the Fox News-built assumption that teenagers can go
    on hormone therapy with ease; this mode of operation was not built by
    genuine reporting and understanding of the method of treatment, rather by a
    right-wing media environment that demonizes transgender individuals.</p>
  <p>Following the Supreme Court’s decision in Skrmetti, numerous medical
    professional organizations have come out in anger and disappointment as to
    the future of transgender healthcare in the United States. The Endocrine
    Society, American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, American
    Psychiatric Association, American Academy of Pediatrics, American College of
    Physicians, and many others have all come out to say that the Tennessee bill
    puts transgender teenagers at grave risk.</p>
  <p>Justice Thomas might want to reconsider his examination that these
    organizations have “compromised their medical recommendations to achieve
    political ends.” In this episode of social conservatism staining the court,
    it seems like the only compromise to achieve political ends is being done by
    Justice Thomas himself.</p>
  <p><strong>Scrutiny</strong></p>
  <p>The debate revolving around the most efficacious way of treating gender
    dysphoria is a difficult one. Healthcare issues regarding minors is always a
    tumultuous topic, especially when the agency for major decisions rests on an
    individual who is not fully developed. Transgender issues do not only exist
    within the confines of a doctor’s office, but are hotly debated in the
    national media, often leading to a culture of gender skepticism at best and
    transphobia at worst. One cannot easily separate the larger cultural
    conversation regarding transgenderism with the specific discussion
    surrounding the allowance of healthcare for minors with gender dysphoria.
  </p>
  <p>But we do not need to look to the Supreme Court for answers to these
    questions. The Supreme Court is not tasked with assessing the virtues of
    transgenderism or the best method of dealing with gender dysphoria in
    teenagers. The Supreme Court is tasked with ensuring that bills from state
    legislatures do not discriminate based on the tenants left in the Fourteenth
    Amendment. In this case, the Supreme Court failed at viewing Skrmetti
    through the lens of intermediate scrutiny.</p>
  <p>Justice Sotomayor, in delivering her dissenting opinion, notes how the
    availability for state legislatures (as well as the federal government) to
    fully discriminate against transgender individuals has been made much easier
    via the majority opinion in Skrmetti. She writes:</p>
  <p><em>“The Court’s willingness to do so here does irrevocable damage to the
      Equal Protection Clause and invites legislatures to engage in
      discrimination by hiding blatant sex classifications in plain sight.”</em>
  </p>
  <p>Justice Sotomayor further develops this position, noting how transgender
    individuals are already being discriminated against by the Trump
    administration, writing:</p>
  <p><em>“In any event, those searching for more evidence of de jure
      discrimination against transgender individuals, need look no further than
      the present. The Federal Government, for example, has started expelling
      transgender servicemembers from the military and threatening to withdraw
      funding from schools and nonprofits that espouse support for transgender
      individuals.”</em></p>
  <p>The Robert’s Court has made it a staple of their tenure to push back
    against judicial activism, stating that any form of “legislating from the
    bench” goes against their duty as mere interpreters of the Constitution
    rather than legislators. But by siding with Tennessee, they have green-lit
    discrimination based on gender identity and transgender status. Under an
    administration such as this one, where transgender individuals are
    scapegoated and lied about, it is clear to see the dangerous precedent that
    the Supreme Court has allowed.</p>
