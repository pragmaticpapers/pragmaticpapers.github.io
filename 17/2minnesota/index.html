  <p>“This is a robbery.”</p>
  <p>That was the last sentence Senator Hoffman of Minnesota and his wife heard
    from a man at their doorstep before gunfire rang out, according to a newly
    <a
      href="https://s3.documentcloud.org/documents/25976596/boelterfederalaffidavit.pdf">released</a>
    federal affidavit. It had been the first shooting in a string of attempted
    assassinations against lawmakers across Minnesota. The suspect had
    impersonated a police officer minutes before shots rang out, shouting, “This
    is the police. Open the door.” The suspect had been wearing a black tactile
    vest when the Hoffmans realized that the man at their door was wearing a
    mask and was therefore not a police officer. However, their efforts to get
    away from the suspect had failed, as the suspect shot Mr. and Mrs. Hoffman
    repeatedly. Senator Hoffman’s daughter then called 911. Thankfully, they had
    survived, but nobody knew what was to come.</p>

  <p>In a police-style vehicle, the suspect then drove to the home of another
    Minnesota representative. After the suspect rang the doorbell multiple times
    and shouted that a police officer was at the door, it became known that the
    official and her family were not home. Therefore, the suspect left the
    house. Later, an officer had spotted the suspect down the road from yet
    another Minnesota representative’s home. When the officer tried to speak
    with the suspect, he stared straight ahead and was unresponsive. The suspect
    then left the area.</p>
  <p>After local law enforcement had heard of the shooting at Senator Hoffman’s
    home, they traveled to the home of Melissa Hortman, the Speaker of the
    Minnesota House of Representatives. Upon arriving, law enforcement saw the
    police-style vehicle with a fake police license plate. Additionally, they
    saw the same suspect standing near the front door. Two sets of gunfire then
    followed as the suspect moved forward. He then fled the scene. When the
    officers entered the home, they found Speaker Hortman and her husband shot
    inside the home. Additionally, their family dog had been gravely injured.
    Speaker Hortman and her husband would later pass away from their injuries.
  </p>
  <p>When officers searched the vehicle, they found evidence tying Vance Boelter
    to the SUV and several notebooks full of hand-written notes. These notebooks
    contained the names of more than 45 Minnesota state and federal public
    officials, including Speaker Hortman. Additionally, they contained lists of
    internet-based people search engines that aggregate home addresses and phone
    numbers for users of the websites. Law enforcement also found a website in
    the notebooks that advertised a mask similar to the one Boelter wore. In
    addition to the notebooks, law enforcement also found five firearms in the
    SUV. In the same area, law enforcement found a flashlight, a tactical body
    armor vest, and a mask. The suspect was later spotted in a field after 43
    hours of searching and was then taken into custody.</p>

  <p>Later, it was <a
      href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/gov-walz-rep-omar-dozens-minnesota-democrats-gunmans/story?id=122847427">revealed</a>
    by ABC News that those on Boelter’s target list included Governor Tim Walz,
    U.S. Rep. Ilhan Omar, U.S. Sen. Tina Smith, and state Attorney General Keith
    Ellison. Most of those on the list were Democrats. Furthermore, abortion
    providers and pro-choice activists were listed as targets as well.
    Authorities also <a
      href="https://x.com/MnDPS_MSP/status/1933918239504929129">found</a> flyers
    inside Boelter’s car that said “No Kings” on them. The No Kings protest was
    happening across the country on the day that the shooting occurred so the
    Minnesota State Patrol later asked that the public not attend the protests.
    However, the Minnesota protests would later go on without incident.</p>
  <p>The suspect, Vance Boelter, was <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/14/us/politics/minnesota-shootings-gunman-suspect.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Q08.Ufi8.GRFOhRhZJ2uy&amp;smid=url-share">appointed</a>
    to the Minnesota Governor’s Workforce Development Board by the former
    Democratic governor of Minnesota. Governor Tim Walz would reappoint him
    later. He had served on the largely nonpartisan board with State Senator
    John Hoffman, one of the victims who survived the shooting. This caused many
    Republicans to blame Democrats for the shooting, including Senator Mike Lee
    who seemed to shift blame toward Governor Waltz when he <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/mike-lee-posts-senate-minnesota-lawmakers-shot-eb58f097a2e627b9441f64ac6f7bbaa8?utm_source=copy&amp;utm_medium=share">posted</a>
    on X, “Nightmare on Waltz street,” alongside an image of the shooter. </p>
  <p>Later, it was <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/06/14/us/politics/minnesota-shootings-gunman-suspect.html?unlocked_article_code=1.Q08.Ufi8.GRFOhRhZJ2uy&amp;smid=url-share">revealed</a>
    that Boelter preached at a church in central Africa. In a sermon, it
    appeared as if Boelter criticized gay and transgender people. Additionally,
    Boelter’s roommate would later go on to say that he voted for President
    Trump in the 2024 election.</p>
  <p>Of course, when an act of political violence like this occurs, the victim
    should always be remembered. Speaker Hortman tried to reach across both
    sides of the aisle to work in a bipartisan fashion. Governor Walz would go
    on to describe Hortman as “the most consequential Speaker in [Minnesota’s]
    history.” On June 18th, hundreds <a
      href="https://www.cbsnews.com/minnesota/news/melissa-mark-hortman-minnesota-state-capitol-candlelight-vigil/">gathered</a>
    at the Minnesota state capitol to remember Speaker Hortman and her husband.
    The crowd sang “Amazing Grace” and the memorial, which sprang up outside the
    Capitol, included flowers alongside American flags. A blanket laid out on
    the ground allowed attendees to write messages. One written message <a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/19/minnesota-capitol-vigil-killings-melissa-hortman">said</a>:
    “Melissa was a true model of humility. She didn’t do this work to boost her
    own ego, further her political career or garner fame and glory. She did it
    to improve people’s lives.”</p>
