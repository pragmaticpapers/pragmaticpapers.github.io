      Operation Al Aqsa Flood was the pinnacle result of months and years of
      planning and training. The Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad fighters
      who launched the raids into Israel on October 7 chose their targets on the
      other side of the border from Gaza with a meticulousness which might rival
      operational planning in regular militaries. The depth and scope of the
      raids were matched only by their brutality and is to date the largest
      terrorist attack in Israeli history. Despite this, the raid's planners had
      had far grander objectives than a sole attack into southern Israel. In
      fact, Al Aqsa Flood had been meant to be a clarion call for larger attacks
      from Hezbollah in the north, and affiliates in the West Bank. The goal, in
      Hamas' own<a

      >
        words</a
      >, was the total overrunning of every city, town and village, in what
      would have been a shocking replication of October 7 across Israel.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      From this perspective, Hamas was unsuccessful in drawing in its allies to
      the fight. While Israel did subsequently fight a separate war with
      Hezbollah, the conflict was itself brief and dominated by Israeli
      operational and strategic<a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/lebanon-israel-hezbollah-airstrikes-28-september-2024-c4751957433ff944c4eb06027885a973"
      >
        victories</a
      >. However for residents of northern Israel, as rockets screamed overhead
      and air raid sirens wailed across northern Israel, life along the Lebanese
      border became a haunting mirror of the crisis playing out in the south. In
      towns like Kiryat Shmona, Metula, and Shtula, residents have faced not
      only the psychological burden of constant alerts but also the physical
      destruction wrought by Hezbollah’s escalating missile attacks. Though the
      war in Gaza has largely dominated global headlines, the northern front has
      become a second battleground—an extension of the conflict that has
      fractured Israel's sense of internal security and displacing tens of
      thousands of civilians. From burned-out buildings to shuttered schools and
      ghost towns emptied by evacuations, the scale of disruption in the north
      reveals a hidden cost of the broader war.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The war in Gaza sparked a dangerous and destabilizing parallel conflict on
      Israel’s northern border, where Hezbollah, backed by Iran and operating
      with rhetorical and logistical coordination with Hamas, had mounted a
      sustained campaign of rocket, drone, and missile attacks. In doing so,
      Hezbollah not only threatened Israeli military assets but also inflicted
      severe hardship on civilian communities. In examining the military
      dimension of this threat, the human toll on northern populations, the
      destruction of property and infrastructure, and the ceasefire that ended
      the most recent Israel, Hezbollah confrontation, it highlights a critical
      but underreported front of the war-one with regional implications and
      enduring consequences for Israeli security.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Since the outbreak of the conflict, Hezbollah has actively opened a
      northern front against Israel, transforming what began as a localized
      conflict into a broader regional confrontation. Within a day of the
      October 7 Hamas attacks, Hezbollah launched a series of rocket and missile
      barrages from southern Lebanon targeting Israeli communities along the
      border. The Lebanese militia deployed an array of weaponry including
      rockets, anti-tank guided missiles, and armed drones, testing Israeli air
      defense systems and forcing as many as 60,000 to<a
        href="https://www.rferl.org/a/israel-hezbollah-lebanon-war-life/33153872.html"
      >
        flee</a
      >
      their homes. Though many of the attacks appear designed to harass and
      distract, the scope and frequency of the firepower suggest a coordinated
      effort to overstretch the Israeli military and draw attention to
      Hezbollah’s continued relevance as part of the so-called “Axis of
      Resistance” aligned with Iran.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The group had largely avoided direct territorial incursions but had ramped
      up its cross-border fire, possibly as a show of solidarity with Hamas or
      as part of a broader Iranian-led effort to pressure Israel on multiple
      fronts. These actions prompted forceful responses from the Israel Defense
      Forces (IDF), including airstrikes on southern Lebanon and targeted
      killings of senior Hezbollah operatives. Yet despite the violence,
      Hezbollah maintained a certain level of calculated restraint, engaging in
      limited actions rather than a major offensive. One<a
        href="https://www.washingtoninstitute.org/policy-analysis/hezbollahs-deadly-rockets-arent-most-serious-threat-israels-northern-border"
      >
        explanation</a
      >
      for this pattern might suggest that its involvement is mostly symbolic,
      designed to assert its independence while avoiding the political and
      military costs of a full-blown war.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hezbollah’s rocket and missile attacks, launched in “solidarity” with
      Hamas, created an environment of constant fear for residents in cities and
      towns across the north of Israel. As barrages became more frequent and
      destructive, the human cost began to mount. Dozens of Israeli civilians
      have been killed or wounded in cross-border attacks. For residents, the
      violence has become not just a strategic threat but an intimate, personal
      terror—felt in every siren, every thud of impact, and every night spent in
      bomb shelters. Beyond the physical toll, the psychological damage is more
      difficult to measure but equally severe. The persistent threat of missile
      attacks has left many residents with symptoms of anxiety, insomnia, and
      post-traumatic stress, particularly among children and the elderly. Mental
      health services in northern towns have been overwhelmed as families
      grapple with the emotional strain of prolonged exposure to conflict.
      Parents report difficulty calming their children, while schools struggle
      to maintain any sense of routine amid closures and emergency drills. For
      those who have experienced conflict in previous wars such as the 2006
      Lebanon War, this round of violence has reopened old wounds and triggered
      new trauma, amplifying the perception that their communities are living in
      a state of chronic vulnerability.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The Israeli government’s response to the danger involved large-scale<a
        href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2GygGlfhhWA&amp;ab_channel=93.1WIBC"
      >
        evacuations</a
      >
      of border towns, displacing tens of thousands of residents. Evacuees from
      towns within miles of the Lebanese border had been relocated to hotels and
      temporary shelters across the country. While these relocations have
      prevented additional casualties, they have also fractured communities and
      placed enormous logistical and financial burdens on both the government
      and the displaced. Families have been separated, businesses shuttered, and
      entire local economies halted. For evacuees, uncertainty looms large: How
      long will they be gone? Will their homes be intact when they return? And
      can normal life resume if the ceasefire does not hold?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Despite the hardships, many residents have shown resilience, with mutual
      aid networks and local volunteer groups stepping in to support those
      displaced. Still, the mood in the north remains somber and tense. Among
      those who remain, there is a widespread feeling of abandonment, a belief
      that the suffering of the north is being overshadowed by the war in Gaza.
      While media attention and international focus have concentrated on
      southern Israel and Gaza, the people of the north—caught between political
      maneuvering and military escalation—feel they are bearing a quiet,
      underreported share of this war’s cost. Their trauma, though less visible,
      is no less real.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      The northern regions of Israel, once quiet and agriculturally rich, have
      endured significant damage to property and public infrastructure as a
      result of Hezbollah’s sustained rocket and missile attacks. Homes and
      property across the area have been struck by direct fire, leaving behind<a

      >
        scorched ruins</a
      >, shattered windows, and cratered roads. Schools and community centers
      have also been damaged, some beyond repair, forcing a suspension of public
      services and education in affected zones. According to early<a
        href="https://www.al-monitor.com/originals/2024/05/hezbollah-barrages-deal-heavy-damage-northern-israel"
      >
        estimates</a
      >
      by local authorities, hundreds of buildings have suffered varying degrees
      of destruction, creating a landscape of abandonment and decay in areas
      once marked by stability and growth.

    </div>
    <p>
      Beyond residential damage, the attacks have deeply wounded the local
      economy, particularly in agricultural and small business sectors amounting
      to hundreds of millions of dollars in losses. Northern Israel is home to
      numerous farms and vineyards, many of which have been forced to shut down
      due to missile fire and evacuations. Fields lie untended, crops have
      spoiled, and livestock have been lost or relocated. Similarly, the
      region’s tourism industry, especially popular for scenic retreats and
      historical sites, has ground to a halt. Business owners report mounting
      financial losses and a lack of clear timelines for return or recovery,
      with insurance payouts delayed and government compensation programs slow
      to materialize.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Some displaced residents<a

      >
      to their homes have found them in states of disrepair, with little clarity
      on whether they’ll receive assistance in time for winter. Contractors and
      local authorities are stretched thin, trying to assess damage while also
      preparing for the possibility of renewed conflict. For many in the north,
      the damage to infrastructure is not just physical but symbolic—a reminder
      of how vulnerable they remain to regional tensions that can erupt at any
      moment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Iran plays a central role in the broader escalation that has linked the
      Gaza conflict to Israel’s northern front. As the chief patron of both
      Hamas and Hezbollah, Tehran has long invested in a coordinated Axis of
      Resistance strategy that seeks to encircle Israel through proxy forces.
      This strategy came into sharper relief during the current Gaza war, as
      Hezbollah launched thousands of rockets and missiles from Lebanon while
      Iranian-backed groups in Syria and Iraq made threats or attempted strikes.
      Intelligence reports and statements from Israeli defense officials suggest
      that Iran not only encouraged Hezbollah’s involvement but also supplied
      advanced weaponry and logistical support in anticipation of a prolonged,
      multi-front confrontation. While Tehran seeks to maintains plausible
      deniability, its fingerprints are widely seen across the arc of attacks
      stretching from Gaza to Israel’s northern border.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Hamas, too, has made efforts to turn the northern front into an additional
      pressure point. Though primarily based in Gaza, Hamas maintains cells in
      southern Lebanon, some of which have reportedly attempted independent
      rocket attacks on northern Israel. These operations, though often less
      sophisticated than Hezbollah’s, reflect the group's aim to stretch Israeli
      defenses and amplify the sense of siege. The convergence of Hezbollah’s
      disciplined military capabilities with Hamas’s ideological fervor and
      Iranian strategic backing underscores a regional alignment that poses a
      unique challenge to Israel’s security establishment. The attacks from
      Lebanon are not isolated incidents—they are part of a wider effort to
      establish a persistent threat posture that forces Israel to defend on
      multiple fronts and raises the specter of a larger, more devastating
      conflict.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      What began as a series of daily exchanges quickly evolved into sustained
      military engagements between the IDF and Hezbollah units operating near
      the border. The IDF responded with targeted airstrikes and artillery
      barrages aimed at Hezbollah infrastructure, command posts, and suspected
      launch sites. These operations, while designed to suppress further
      attacks, also risked expanding the conflict into a full-blown northern
      war—one that many Israeli officials feared could be more destructive than
      the campaign in Gaza due to Hezbollah’s more advanced weapons and deeper
      entrenchment.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Among northern Israeli residents, the ceasefire reached in November
      between Israel and Hezbollah had been greeted with both relief and deep<a
        href="https://www.timesofisrael.com/despite-israel-hezbollah-ceasefire-deal-northern-residents-fear-returning-home/"
      >
        skepticism</a
      >. Many displaced families have expressed hesitation about returning to
      their homes, citing fears that Hezbollah’s arsenals remain intact and
      ready to be deployed again at short notice. The government, meanwhile,
      faces increasing pressure to strengthen northern defenses and ensure that
      civilians are not caught off guard in the event of another flare-up. For
      now, the border remains tense but quiet—yet the scars left by the latest
      round of violence, both physical and psychological, suggest that peace in
      the north is as<a

      >
      as ever, and likely contingent on broader regional dynamics still in flux.

    <p>
      The war in Gaza may have dominated global headlines, but its
      reverberations have been deeply felt far from the southern border.
      Northern Israeli communities, long accustomed to a fragile calm with
      Hezbollah across the border, have found themselves thrust back into a
      state of siege. With homes damaged, thousands displaced, and the sound of
      air raid sirens returning to daily life, the sense of unease persists even
      as a ceasefire with Hezbollah appears to take hold. Yet for many residents
      of towns like Metula, Shlomi, and Kiryat Shmona, the physical and
      psychological scars left by weeks of conflict will not be easily healed.
      Beyond the broken glass and charred hillsides, there is a pervasive sense
      that the northern front is no longer a dormant threat—it has reawakened
      with intensity.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      While the ceasefire between Israel and Hezbollah has brought a degree of
      quiet, it is a quiet laced with dread. The war’s expansion to the north
      laid bare how interconnected the theaters of conflict truly are, and many
      fear that the lull is merely a pause before a broader confrontation.
      Northern residents now face the difficult question of whether it is safe
      to return home or if they must prepare for another round of hostilities.
      The challenge for Israeli leaders is not only rebuilding damaged homes but
      also restoring a sense of long-term security in a region that increasingly
      feels like a buffer zone in a larger regional war. For now, the war in
      Gaza may be slowing, but for those in Israel’s north, the memory and the
      threat remain starkly alive.
