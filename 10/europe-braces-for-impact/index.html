      imperialist invasion against Ukraine. With the shadow of Russia
      threatening Europe, the continent has begun the long process of defense
      autonomy. As Europe braces for impact, it has shown a new mentality
      towards its own security, one free of over reliance on other superpowers,
      and free of the decades of underinvestment of the previous world order.

      from EUR 5.70 to EUR 8.10, a 39% net profit in 2024, and reported a sales
      growth of 50% compared to the previous year. The company is looking to
      evolve into an all-purpose contractor, in the style of American companies.
      It has made acquisitions such as US Loc Performance Products, software
      developer Blackned, and ammo recovery firm Stascheit. The company is
      clearly poised for massive growth into the 2030’s, with the Zeitenwende in
      full effect and the EU’s push to “Buy European”.

      Airbus in France has also been stepping up to the plate. The company has
      reported a revenue growth of
      <a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AIR.PA/">11%</a>, and EBIT
      Adjusted was at 77 million euros, compared to -9 million euros at the same
      time last year. Defense companies all across Europe are booming thanks to
      this ideological shift towards defense autonomy. The company’s CEO
      Guillaume Faury said, “Airbus is committed to European defense and
      strategic autonomy. And we stand ready and we already do support our
      government customers with our strong portfolio of products and
      solutions.”. In response to American tariffs, the company is looking to
      export to other countries who have international operations.

      Europe is turning the gears of war, preparing for the inevitable upcoming
      conflict with Russia, or worse, China. Countries like Italy and Spain must
      follow the growing trend, and reverse their reluctance to increase defense
      spending, as only united can Europe stand. The EU needs to break its
      reliance on American contractors, and look to position its own rapidly
      growing defense companies to fill the supply gaps.

    <p>
      With defense firms firing up, inter-state cohesion between them is looking
      to be a strategic priority. Without working together, European companies
      cannot hope to possibly match the production speed and efficiency of
      American companies. EU members must work together with its new budget
      reforms and defense spending to produce products that are true
      alternatives to the American versions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Europe has several competing models for tanks, submarines, planes, and
      frigates. Though the Eurofighter, produced jointly by Germany, Spain,
      Italy, and the UK, is a prime example of European collaboration, it is
      still competing with the French Rafale and Swedish Gripen. And despite all
      this, the most popular choice in NATO countries is the American made F-35,
      which locks countries into more US dependence for 20 years. Countries
      could merge into giants, eyeing for unified contracts, in the example of
      Lockheed Martin and Boeing for the F-47, but such mergers are unlikely to
      occur.
    </p>
    <p>
      Collaboration is more realistic and more practical, aiming to combine the
      strengths of each nation, and thus, combine production costs and efforts.

        >Europe incentives investment in joint-Euro projects</a

      countries represents at least 70 percent of the estimated end product
      value will be funded under it, showing an acknowledgment of this need by
      the EU. Companies like MBDA, which is jointly owned by Airbus, BAE, and
      Leonardo, show a clear guideline for other projects to follow in the
      coming rearmament of the continent. It functions as one company, while
      retaining national subsidiaries. Its

      function in Patriot systems and have replaced older legacy systems such as
      the Spada and Sea Dart, among others. Rheinmetall has joined forces with
      Leonardo to replace the Leopard 2, and in 2024, the<a

      But Europe still lacks in some key sectors, showing vulnerabilities in the
      lofty plans for the future of the defense sector. Europe does not have
      high altitude missile defense systems, such as Israel’s Arrow 3 system.
      Though the EU introduced the<a

      >

      in 2022, it relied heavily on NATO infrastructure and cooperation,
      something that is increasingly unlikely in the ever shifting global power
      structure. EU officials have identified capability gaps in regards to
      <a

        >drones</a

      >, and <a href="http://cyberwarfare">cyberwarfare</a>. As Europe’s defense
      sector wakes up from its post Cold War slumber, it must adapt to the
      times, and develop cutting edge AI gigafactories and drones of its own. It
      has already begun the crucial steps towards building gigafactories, for
      example, but
      <a

      from competing with the US or China.
    </p>
    <p>
      Europe is on the precipice of a continent wide defense reformation. As
      promising as the growth has looked so far, the momentum must be sustained.
      EU member states must look to prevent far-right or far-left parties from
      taking center stage, with their reluctance to spend on defense in a
      transparent attempt to curry favor from Russia. This requires changing the
      minds of the everyday European, away from isolationist movements such as
      Brexit, and into this new world order, one without Big Brother Washington
      protecting Europe’s every step. Indeed, it has begun bracing for impact…
      But bracing is not enough. Europe must lean forward into the storm,
      forging a united front that is not just reactive, but resilient. The
      challenge is not only in defense, it is cultural, political, and
      generational. Leaders must speak with clarity, act with conviction, and
      make defense not a burden, but a backbone of sovereignty. The window to
      shape this new era is narrow, and hesitation invites erosion. Europe
      stands at the forge; either it tempers steel, or it melts in the heat.
