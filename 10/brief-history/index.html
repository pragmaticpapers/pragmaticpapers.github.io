      Migration remains one of the most divisive issues in European politics,
      consistently ranking among voters top concerns. Most attention focuses on
      arrivals from <em>outside</em> the EU. Yet large migratory flows
      <em>within</em> the Union have profoundly reshaped both the receiving and
      the sending countries, economically and socially, and are often overlooked
      in discussions about the evolution of the European project.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Schengen Agreement, originally signed in 1985, heralded the abolition
      of internal borders among participating countries (currently 29 member
      states), beginning in 1995. Nevertheless, of greater pertinence was the
      signing of the Maastricht Treaty in 1992, which established that all EU
      citizens have the right to free movement across the entirety of the EU.
    </p>

    <h4>The Perpetual Shrinkage of Bulgaria</h4>

    <p>
      In 2023 Bulgaria recorded the worlds second-fastest population decline,
      behind only war-torn Ukraine, a continuation of a long downward trend.<sup
        ><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
      >
      EU membership in 2007 accelerated outward migration, and when
      labour-market restrictions disappeared in 2014 the exodus quickened.<sup
        ><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup
      >
      Today roughly one-quarter of all Bulgarians live abroad, most of them of
      working age, with severe consequences at home.<sup
        ><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      Health care illustrates the damage: Bulgaria has the EUs worst nurse-to-
      patient ratio because a third of newly trained nurses and about 40% of the
      countrys doctors now practise abroad.<sup
        ><a href="#fn4" id="ref4">4</a></sup
      >
      Overall, high-skill flight costs the economy an estimated 0.7 percentage
      points of GDP each year (OECD modelling).<sup
        ><a href="#fn5" id="ref5">5</a></sup
      >
      The loss feeds a vicious circle of dwindling confidence Bulgarians who
      remain often question the states future despite the country’s rich
      culture, appealing landscape and favourable climate.
    </p>

    <h4>The Rise of Poland, A Notably Different Story</h4>

    <p>
      Polands early post-accession experience looked similar. After joining the
      EU in 2004, millions of Poles seized the chance to work and study in other
      member states, most visibly in the United Kingdom.<sup
        ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
      >
      Alongside migrants from fellow Central- and Eastern-European entrants,
      this east-to-west wave upended expectations. Despite earlier debates
      focusing on non-EU migrants, the sudden influx dominated Britains media
      cycle. Right-leaning outlets leveraged the newcomers as proof of unchecked
      EU influence, stoking Eurosceptic sentiment that would ultimately help
      propel the 2016 Brexit vote.<sup><a href="#fn7" id="ref7">7</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The large net outflow created shortages of nurses akin to Bulgaria’s
      current experience, and the loss of working-age residents was palpable.
      One key difference, however, is that the Polish economy proved more
      robust; it absorbed and even benefited from wage pressure, lifting living
      standards for workers and, indirectly, pensioners as an appreciating zoty
      made imports cheaper.<sup><a href="#fn8" id="ref8">8</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      The trend reversed, and by 2019 Poland had moved into net
      <em>immigration</em>.<sup><a href="#fn9" id="ref9">9</a></sup> Many Poles
      returned with skills and savings accumulated abroad. The turnaround
      coincided with rapid GDP growth already visible by 2016, partly spurred by
      Brexit-related emigration from the UK but not limited to it.<sup
        ><a href="#fn10" id="ref10">10</a></sup
      >
      Governance also mattered: in 2016 Transparency International ranked Poland
      35th worldwide,<sup><a href="#fn11" id="ref11">11</a></sup> and efficient
      absorption of EU funds reinforced investor confidence.<sup
        ><a href="#fn12" id="ref12">12</a></sup
      >
      Although later judicial disputes dented that record, Poland still scores
      around the EU average on corruption metrics and continues to attract both
      returning citizens and foreign workers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Between 2016 and 2019 Poland averaged 4 percent real GDP growth, a pace
      that aligned closely with the reversal of its migration balance.<sup
        ><a href="#fn13" id="ref13">13</a></sup
      >
      The comparison with Bulgaria underscores a key lesson: when wage
      convergence, sound institutions and active return policies align, a brain
      drain can become brain circulation, turning emigration from a liability
      into an engine of domestic growth.
    </p>
    <p>
      Other member states that joined the EU in the 2000s lie somewhere between
      the extremes of Poland and Bulgaria. Lithuania recorded its first positive
      migration balance in 2019,<sup><a href="#fn14" id="ref14">14</a></sup>
      Latvia is effectively neutral,<sup><a href="#fn15" id="ref15">15</a></sup>
      and Bulgarias northern neighbour Romania posted its first ever surplus in
      2022/23.<sup><a href="#fn16" id="ref16">16</a></sup>
    </p>

    <h4>The Impact on Receiving Countries of New Member State Emigration</h4>

    <p>
      The 2004 and 2007 enlargements had striking effects on the main receiving
      states, notably the United Kingdom, Germany, Ireland and the Netherlands.
      In Britain the number of Polish nationals alone reached about one million
      by 2016, making Poles the countrys largest foreign nationality group.<sup
        ><a href="#fn6" id="ref6">6</a></sup
      >
      These migrants filled acute shortages in construction, food processing,
      hospitality and the National Health Service; a UCL study found they paid
      £45 billion <em>more</em> in taxes than they drew in services between 2004
      and 2011.<sup><a href="#fn17" id="ref17">17</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Germany posted similar gains, as East-European workers kept factories
      fully staffed and limited wage-driven inflation during the mid-2010s
      boom.<sup><a href="#fn18" id="ref18">18</a></sup> In Ireland,
      East-European immigrants accounted for nearly a quarter of all new
      labour-force entrants in the decade to 2015, easing demographic
      pressure.<sup><a href="#fn19" id="ref19">19</a></sup> Across the host
      economies the evidence is clear: East European migrants boosted GDP,
      helped finance ageing welfare systems and demonstrated the non-zero-sum
      nature of intra-EU mobility despite modest, localised wage pressures at
      the low-skill end.
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside their economic contributions, East-European arrivals have intro-
      duced a host of new culinary and cultural touches to supermarket aisles
      and high streets. Today youll find Polish <em>kiebasa </em>and
      <em>pierogi </em>alongside German sausages, Romanian <em>zacusc </em>and
      Bulgarian <em>sirene </em>cheese in major chains.<sup
        ><a href="#fn20" id="ref20">20</a></sup
      >
      Often Tescos supermarkets in the UK have their own Polish isles including
      sweets and sausages alike. Beyond food, local councils host Slavic folk
      dance workshops and events such as the Balkan Traffic festival in
      Brussels.<sup><a href="#fn21" id="ref21">21</a></sup>
    </p>

    <p>
      Despite the evident benefits, one should also consider how internal EU mi-
      gration is perceived. Generally speaking, internal EU migrants are held in
      higher esteem than those coming from non-EU countries, as highlighted by a
      2024 Eurobarometer survey which saw EU migrants being viewed favourably
      (67%) compared to non-EU migrants (46%).<sup
        ><a href="#fn25" id="ref25">25</a></sup
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      When viewed negatively, one common trope is that migrants are more likely
      to commit crime. There is sparse research distinguishing between non-EU
      and EU migrants with regard to their criminal activities. However, in the
      German context, once a migrant’s socio-economic status is taken into
      account, immigrants as a whole are no more likely to commit crimes than
      German citizens, with their overall overrepresentation largely reflecting
      the higher concentration of the immigrant population in urban areas.<sup
        ><a href="#fn26" id="ref26">26</a></sup
      >
    </p>

    <h4>A likely Source of Future Flows, the Storm on the Horizon</h4>

    <p>
      Thus far internal migration has been overall favourable to the EU both
      socially and economically despite attempts by right wing outlets to
      suggest to the contrary.
    </p>
    <p>
      The story of intra-EU migration over the past two decades reveals a
      dynamic, mostly self-correcting system. Initial east-to-west flows
      relieved unemployment in the sender states and powered growth in the
      receivers; over time, rising wages, return incentives and institutional
      reforms began to pull workers back east. It remains to be seen in the
      Bulgarian case if the benefits will be fully realised though this is
      likely simply a matter of time and a greater willingness to drive down
      corruption.
    </p>
    <p>
      Nevertheless, climate stress now threatens to push new waves northward
      from the Mediterranean that may be a far more sinister affair. A 2023
      <em>Nature Communications</em> model coupling sea-level-rise exposure with
      population flows projects up to 20 million internal movers across the
      Mediterranean basin by 2100 if no adaptation occurs.<sup
        ><a href="#fn22" id="ref22">22</a></sup
      >
      Most net emigration originates from Spain, Italy, Greece and Croatia,
      while in-migration concentrates in higher elevation urban corridors
      stretching into France, Germany, Belgium and the Netherlands, although the
      latter is itself threatened by sea-level rise.
    </p>
    <p>
      Eurofound assessments show that heat stress driven productivity losses
      will rise three-to-four times faster in Southern than in Northern Europe,
      reinforcing the economic pull towards cooler labour markets.<sup
        ><a href="#fn23" id="ref23">23</a></sup
      >
      Already in 2023 olive oil output fell by 40,<sup
        ><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup
      >
      and the Joint Research Centres July 2024 briefing on persistent droughts
      warned of critical water shortages menacing crops in Spain, Portugal,
      southern Italy and Greece.<sup><a href="#fn24" id="ref24">24</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite much of recent internal shifts in population having been mutually
      favourable, without bold measurements the level of future migration may be
      on a vastly different scale with little to no benefit to sender countries.
      If climate driven migration is not mitigated the possible internal strife
      may end up being the biggest threat to the European project.
