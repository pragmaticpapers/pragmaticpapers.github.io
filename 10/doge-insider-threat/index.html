    <p><strong>DOGE is a threat to our nation</strong></p>
    <p>
      Elon tries to hide behind the cutesy AI-generated dog logo and dead-meme
      initials, but DOGE needs to be exclusively framed as a direct threat to
      American security. This past week we learned from whistleblower Daniel
      Berulis that Russia seems to have real-time access to some aspect of
      DOGE’s systems. DOGE isn't just undermining American cybersecurity through
      incompetence, it's operating as an insider threat by dismantling critical
      infrastructure, mishandling data, and opening the door for hostile nations
      like Russia to exploit American systems.

    <p><strong>DOGE currently employs a teenage cybercriminal</strong></p>

      If you follow cybersecurity news, or have visited a Vegas casino since
      2023, you may have heard of the ransomware attack that
      <a

        >took down MGM</a
      >. This attack is attributed to Scattered Spider, a fractal of threat
      actor group “The Com.” The Com is a social web of threat actor groups
      coordinating over Discord and Telegram. Turns out interning at Neuralink
      allows you to skip the clearance process–DOGE employs a teenager that
      previously sold

      to The Com, 19-year-old Edward Coristine. Coristine didn’t have a great
      reputation, it seems.

      No, that’s not the compsci channel; those are the internal chats of a
      fractal of The Com. Lastly, Coristine was fired from Path Networks, a
      DDoS-protection company known for hiring ex-criminals, for
      <em>leaking internal documents to a competitor</em>. Not fucking good!

      While DOGE demands sweeping access to sensitive federal data, it's gutting
      the teams tasked with defending that data. The Cybersecurity and
      Infrastructure Security Agency (CISA) — a lesser-known but vital agency —
      protects critical infrastructure like hospitals and power grids. One of
      CISA’s
      <a
        href="https://www.darkreading.com/threat-intelligence/cisa-red-team-disarray-cyber-defenses"
        >losses</a
      >
      is a program that shared threat intel with states and organizations that
      couldn’t afford to collect their own. Although some of us are proponents
      of ending blue states’ subsidization of red states, decreasing data
      protection is only benefitting rival nations. This is just one example of
      the critical teams DOGE laid off as it works to cut CISA’s funding
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/weekly-cybersecurity/2025/04/07/cisas-next-cut-is-the-deepest-00276032"

      <a

        >put it bluntly</a
      >
      while testifying before Congress:
    </p>
    <p>
      “I want to raise my grave concerns that the aggressive threats to cut U.S.
      government probationary employees will have a devastating effect on
      cybersecurity and our national security.”
    </p>
    <p><strong>No, Really, Here You Go, Russia</strong></p>
    <p>
      And how prescient Rob Joyce was: whistleblower
      <a
        href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/show/nlrb-whistleblower-claims-musks-doge-potentially-caused-significant-security-breach"
        >Daniel Berulis</a
      >
      alleged that DOGE requested and received unrestricted access to the
      National Labor Relations Board’s data. This data was accessed at a
      permission level so high that normal audit trails weren’t created, and
      DOGE deleted other evidence of their access. Importantly, immediately
      after DOGE employees created NLRB accounts,
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfosecurity.com/whistleblower-complaint-exposes-doge-cybersecurity-failures-a-28046"
        >Russia</a
      >
      tried to log in using their credentials. The seriousness of this cannot be
      overstated, with the amount of data DOGE is collecting and compiling. The
      bottom line is clear: DOGE’s reckless behavior directly handed
      opportunities to hostile foreign powers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Musk’s time running DOGE may be
      <a href="https://pragmaticpapers.github.io/06/musks-exit-wound/"
        >coming to a close</a
      >, but all of this data is still vulnerable. This is all just what we know
      publicly. DOGE’s poor security practices are a breeding ground for harm to
      Americans and a benefit to rival nations. DOGE isn’t just negligent. It’s
      an insider threat. And everyone who enabled it needs to be held
      accountable.
