      Jose Hermosillo was already having a pretty crappy day when he got out of
      the ER after having just suffered a seizure. He was in Tucson, visiting a
      girlfriend, and attempting to find his way when he asked a friendly
      neighborhood ICE officer for help. Hermosillo tried to say he was lost and
      from New Mexico, but the ICE officer detained him for illegally entering
      from Mexico and he was held in ICE custody for 10 days, until his parents
      could provide the authorities with his birth certificate and social
      security card to have him released.

      to and signed paperwork stating he illegally entered the US from Mexico.
      Hermosillo signed something, but since he can’t read and can only write
      his name due to his learning disabilities, he had no idea what he was
      signing.

      <strong>This is why due process is so important.</strong> To be clear,
      sometimes US citizens get caught up in immigration enforcement. According
      to a report from the
      <a href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-21-487#summary_recommend"
        >US Government Accountability Office</a
      >, from 2015 to 2020, 674 potential US citizens were arrested by ICE and
      70 were removed (curiously enough, all those removals happened between
      2017 and 2020). Due process is meant to ensure basic due diligence is done
      when impeding someone's rights. Sometimes, you get a false positive and
      you need checks in the system to make sure that gets sorted out.
    </p>
    <p>
      Well, rest assured, that report is baby shit. It was the Trump V.1 trial
      run and now, he is looking to rearrange the government infrastructure in a
      way that ensures round 2 gets him into the big leagues, and DOGE is
      setting everything in place.

      efforts into overdrive.

        >Several permanent residents and visa holders</a

      have been swept up in this, but with access by connecting the databases at
      the IRS, which houses a database specific for new hires, the HHS for quick
      access to not just sponsors, but the immigrant parents of citizen
      children, and DHS, they will be able to make a robust surveillance state
      to either find– or financial lock out– anyone they want, not just
      immigrants.

      To be sure, they are acting like they are going after hardened criminals
      or antisemitic people, but those are only excuses used to give them the
      cover they need to prep the forts. When it’s set, their targets will
      broaden to whoever has caught their ire and it’s a horrible shame, because
      history has taught us over and over again that powers like this need to be
      constrained. Ensuring this data was compartmentalized is one of the many
      protections being bulldozed.

        >Privacy Act of 1974</a
      >
      was enacted to prohibit federal agencies from disclosing information about
      individuals without their consent and limited sharing across agencies
      outside of routine use exceptions or a law that specifically allowed for
      it. There were efforts to start a federal data bank as early as the
      1950’s, but McCarthyism, and other government scandals, like Watergate,
      made the public very skeptical of the government having that much
      information in one place. That started the practice of siloing.

      In 2014, Obama signed the
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/113th-congress/senate-bill/2521"
        >Federal Information Security Modernization Act</a
      >
      in response to an increase of cyber attacks. This formulated various
      protocols to assess risk and ensure confidentiality. One of the ways to
      limit risk and ensure confidentiality of an agency's data is to limit
      access to outsiders, even other government agencies. This also required
      certain measures for transparency, so when agencies were sharing data,
      there was clarity on what they accessed and for what purpose.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are other domain specific laws like HIPAA, that protects health
      information, or the IRS Code 6103, with strict measures for accessing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Even with these laws in place, there were agencies tasked with
      investigating complaints or reported concerns to ensure the law was
      complied with and civil rights were protected. This was largely handled by
      the
      <a

      >
      (CRCL), which Trump disbanded. So currently, if you think there is some
      form of government overreach, no one knows who to take those concerns to.
      This will work like Trump’s covid policy. Just don’t test for covid, and
      voilà, no covid. Disband the CRCL and voilà, no civil rights violations!

      government name of Edward Coristine. Outside of being a go-getter 19 year

        >concerning evidence of potential security breaches</a
      >. A whistleblower came forward after he saw DOGE’s activity at the NLRB,
      where he worked. Generally, when people go poking around government data,
      because of Obama’s FISMA law, there are logging protocols that keep a
      record of where people go in the dataset, and actions taken within it.
      Except, he claims that DOGE folks turned all that off, and then 10
      gigabytes of data was removed. This information included things like
      proprietary business information, union organizations, and unfair labor
      practice respondents. Then, there was an attempt from Russia to log into
      the data set. Whoever attempted to login had the correct credentials but
      since they were using a Russian IP, the system’s security measures in
      place because of FISMA blocked the login attempt (Thanks Obama!).
    </p>
    <p>
      To be clear, there are ways for agencies to share data, especially for law
      enforcement. But to get access to it, the interested party has to convince
      a judge that the person in question probably committed a crime to obtain a
      warrant. And that process means law enforcement has to know what they are
      looking for and where to find it. If issued a warrant, then the scope of
      their search is limited to what they need. It can be annoying, but that
      kind of stuff protects people from being wrongly scooped up and ensures
      law enforcement has their shit together. It would mean less stories like
      Jose.

      We are not witnessing innovation—we're watching infrastructure for
      selective punishment being built in real time. The question isn't whether
      it's legal. The question is: who will they come for next, and will anyone
      be left with the power—or permission—to say no? We don’t need to imagine
      how this ends—we’ve seen it before. What we haven’t seen is enough people
      willing to stop it.
