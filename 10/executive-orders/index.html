      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>EO 14259 – Restoring American Seafood Competitiveness</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">

    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 talks about how the US has the greatest seafood in the world. It
      makes a wild claim that overregulation harms the seafood industry and that
      fish stocks are in healthy supply.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 Talks about how successful his 2020
      <a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/05/12/2020-10315/promoting-american-seafood-competitiveness-and-economic-growth"
        >EO 13921</a
      >
      helped fishermen, but in the last 4 years regulations have harmed them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 states it is the policy of the US to promote the fishing
      industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders various Secretaries to review and determine which
      regulations should be repealed to assist the fishing industry. It also
      requires them to identify which protected fisheries need to be deregulated
      and allow harvesting again.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is very much in line with the deregulation of the timber and coal
      industries, and the making available of federal lands for exploitation by
      those industries.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      Global fisheries are generally considered overfished, and this EO will
      only contribute to that problem. Not only will the fish from these
      fisheries directly decline, other fisheries will suffer due to the
      migratory nature of many species. The seafood industry in America may
      enjoy some small boost from this in the short term, but long term the
      depletion of these fisheries will not take long, and we will return to the
      high level of imported seafood we are currently at.
