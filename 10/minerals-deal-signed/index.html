      On Sunday, April 27th,
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/27/schumer-trump-russia-ukraine-war-00311751"
        >Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer</a
      >
      came out swinging against President Donald Trump over his recent handling
      of Russia’s war on Ukraine, stating that the administration was not only
      undermining U.S. alliances but also projecting weakness to adversaries.
      Speaking on CNN’s <em>State of the Union</em>, Schumer specifically
      criticized last week's proposed “peace deal”—the one that would have
      Ukraine cede every inch of land taken by Russian forces—calling it a
      direct betrayal of Ukraine and a gift to Putin. “Worst of all, it’s a sign
      that the United States is weak,” Schumer said. And while that’s been
      obvious to many following these events, it’s still important to see it
      called out plainly for what it is: weakness. Even some Republicans, like
      Senator Chuck Grassley, have echoed these concerns, warning that Putin is
      “playing America as a patsy.” And though Trump did finally begin to
      question whether Putin was just leading him along, it still looks like the
      U.S. is preparing to walk away.
    </p>

      Monday, April 28th, President
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/28/trump-told-the-atlantic-that-putin-would-be-fine-in-peace-negotiations-00312198"
        >Trump</a
      >
      continued to remain unpredictable in regards to the war in Ukraine. In an
      interview with The Atlantic, Trump repeatedly insisted Vladimir Putin
      “would be fine” in peace negotiations—apparently having gotten over his
      concerns from just three days ago that Putin might not want peace after
      all. This came just as
      <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/29/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-calls-putins-offer-of-brief-ceasefire-manipulation"
        >Putin</a
      >
      announced a three-day ceasefire for May 8th to May 10th, commemorating the
      Soviet Union’s victory over Nazi Germany in World War II. While the
      Kremlin framed it as a “humanitarian gesture”, Ukraine and its allies were
      quick to call it out as nothing more than a PR stunt.
      <a
        href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2025/apr/29/ukraine-war-briefing-zelenskyy-calls-putins-offer-of-brief-ceasefire-manipulation"
        >President Zelenskyy</a
      >
      instead called for a 30-day ceasefire, stating, “we value people’s lives,
      not parades.” All the while, Trump’s peace deal remains stalled, with both
      Kyiv and Moscow showing no interest in moving it forward.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Tuesday, April 29th, Secretary of State
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/rubio-says-concrete-ukraine-proposals-needed-now-or-us-will-step-back-2025-04-29/"
        >Marco Rubio</a
      >
      issued an ultimatum: unless Russia and Ukraine present concrete proposals
      to end the war, the United States will step back from its current role.
      What role that is remains unclear—we claim the title of “mediator,” but so
      far it feels more like we’re chasing the optics of neutrality than
      enforcing any real leverage. Speaking through State Department spokeswoman
      Tammy Bruce, Rubio declared that the era of vague commitments is over, and
      the burden now lies with both Kyiv and Moscow to show genuine intent to
      negotiate. At a United Nations Security Council meeting, U.S. diplomat
      John Kelley condemned Russia for continued strikes on civilians, while
      still stressing that both nations must take responsibility for securing
      peace. The message is clear: if this process keeps stalling, Washington is
      ready to walk.

      On Wednesday, April 30th, the Trump administration rolled out a
      long-delayed
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/30/world/europe/ukraine-minerals-deal-trump.html"
        >minerals agreement</a
      >
      with Ukraine, creating a joint investment fund that promises to give the
      U.S. a share in Ukraine’s vast untapped natural resources. According to
      Treasury Secretary Scott Bessent, the deal is meant to “signal clearly to
      Russia” that the U.S. supports a free and prosperous Ukraine—but notably
      absent from the agreement are any real security guarantees or commitments
      to ongoing military aid. The move appears designed to give Trump a
      personal stake in Ukraine’s future without tying him to any future
      support. Critics on both sides of the Atlantic have described it as a
      transactional pivot rather than a strategic one, aimed at building
      goodwill with Trump while avoiding hard promises. Meanwhile, the
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-is-open-ukraine-peace-it-cannot-be-achieved-fast-us-wants-kremlin-says-2025-04-30/"
        >Kremlin insisted it’s open to peace</a
      >, but warned the U.S. to stop rushing the process. Putin’s spokesperson
      said the war’s root causes were “too complex” for quick resolution,
      suggesting—yet again—that Russia’s vague interest in diplomacy is little
      more than a stalling tactic. Kyiv, for its part, reiterated it’s ready to
      talk—but only after an unconditional ceasefire. Still, Trump and his
      administration are spinning all this as progress, even if it's just
      another round of gestures without substance.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday, May 1st, the full details of the newly signed
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/01/world/what-we-know-about-trumps-ukraine-mineral-deal-intl"
        >U.S.-Ukraine minerals deal</a
      >
      finally came to light—and with them, a better understanding of just how
      hard Ukraine had to fight to keep its sovereignty intact. After weeks of
      tense back-and-forth and even a temporary suspension of U.S. aid, Ukraine
      ultimately managed to negotiate far more favorable terms than initially
      offered. Trump’s original pitch? A $500 billion claim on Ukraine’s mineral
      reserves, supposedly as “repayment” for past aid. The final agreement
      drops that demand entirely, instead creating a joint reconstruction fund
      where future U.S. assistance counts as investment. Ukraine retains control
      over its subsoil and mining rights, and even forced the deal to name
      Russia as the aggressor—an incredible turnaround given Trump’s past “maybe
      Ukraine is Russia” nonsense. Still, glaring omissions remain: no security
      guarantees, no binding military aid, and no connection to the larger
      ceasefire negotiations. Strategically, the U.S. now has a financial stake
      in Ukraine’s long-term survival—but economically, the deal mostly applies
      to future, not existing, mining operations. While it’s a political win for
      Zelenskyy, the war still rages on, with seven killed in Russian-held
      Ukraine during renewed clashes on Thursday. The minerals deal may mark a
      turning point in U.S.-Ukrainian relations, but it’s not a peace deal—it’s
      a bet.<br /><br />On Friday, May 2nd, two very different realities of the
      war came into sharp focus. First, reports from the United Nations revealed
      a staggering rise in
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/02/world/europe/ukraine-russia-war-cease-fire-talks.html"
        >civilian casualties</a
      >
      since the so-called peace talks began in February. Russian missile and
      drone strikes have intensified, killing nearly 900 more civilians than in
      the same period last year, including 35 people in Sumy on Palm Sunday and
      nine children in Kryvyi Rih. Analysts point out that this spike is
      consistent with Russia’s long-time tactic: escalate violence before
      ceasefire agreements to gain leverage. At the same time, back in
      Washington,
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us-readies-russia-sanctions-over-ukraine-unclear-if-trump-will-sign-sources-say-2025-05-02/"
        >U.S. officials</a
      >
      finalized a new sanctions package targeting Russia’s natural resource and
      banking sectors, including Gazprom, but it’s unclear if Trump will
      actually sign off. Meanwhile, the
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/business/aerospace-defense/us-state-dept-oks-possible-sale-f-16-training-sustainment-ukraine-2025-05-02/"
        >State Department</a
      >
      quietly approved a $310 million sale of F-16 training and sustainment
      support to Ukraine, signaling a rare moment of continued military backing
      even as Trump drags his feet. Despite promoting the recent minerals deal
      as proof of progress, Trump now appears torn, growing frustrated with
      Putin’s refusal to commit to any ceasefire, even as his administration
      continues negotiating with both sides.

      Saturday, May 3rd, the

        >U.S.–Ukraine minerals deal</a
      >
      appeared to tip in Kyiv’s favor, as Russian officials began to grow
      anxious that Washington’s stance may be shifting decisively away from
      Moscow now that the U.S. has material incentives to back Ukraine. The
      Kremlin dismissed the deal as colonialism—one senator calling Ukraine a
      "mineral colony"—but internal concern is mounting that Trump’s closer
      alignment with Zelenskyy could derail Moscow’s hopes for a favorable peace
      settlement. The agreement, now linked to future U.S. military aid and
      reconstruction funding, has removed a major source of friction between
      Trump and Zelenskyy, prompting speculation that Trump may now approach
      peace talks with Putin from a firmer position. Meanwhile,

        >Crimean Tatars</a
      >
      voiced alarm over Trump’s stated willingness to recognize Crimea as
      Russian, calling it a betrayal of democratic values and a green light for
      further ethnic repression. One former political prisoner warned that such
      a move would “sever the link” between occupied Crimea and free Ukraine.
