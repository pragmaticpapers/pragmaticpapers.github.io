      The heat continues to build on Elon and DOGE’s efforts as fresh polls
      showing general dissent from the public are released. A raucous cabinet
      meeting erupted, where department secretaries scrambled to reclaim lost
      territory. Lawsuits are beating down the door, and enough wealth has been
      lost to almost make you feel sorry for him—until you remember he is still
      a billionaire many times over. So, just like any transparent do-gooder
      would respond, Elon is looking for ways to hide his hand, limit damage to
      the “good” politicians, and just keep rotating through the same set of
      lies anytime a microphone is placed in front of him. For what it’s worth,
      the slow steady courts landed a few knocks on him this week.

      Last week, there was another round of
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/02/us/politics/doge-musk-contracts-errors.html"
        >embarrassing errors reported from DOGE’s</a
      >
      “Wall of Receipts” and a list of reportedly cancelled leases that still
      hasn’t reappeared. It’s clear from the supposed savings reported by the
      young folks running DOGE that they didn’t know how to interpret federal
      contracts. This is understandable, but it’s also likely they didn’t
      realize that all this information is public and their work could be
      checked. The contracts posted on DOGE are posted from the
      <a href="https://www.fpds.gov/fpdsng_cms/index.php/en/"
        >Federal Procurement Data System</a
      >, where you can just look stuff up. Don’t know how to use the system, or
      navigate the interface?
      <a
        href="https://www.fpds.gov/downloads/Manuals/FPDS-NG_User_Manual_V15.pdf"
        >The manual is public</a
      >. What about those horrible DEI grants? Just search for those, and you
      might even find one for yourself on
      <a href="http://grants.gov">grants.gov</a>. Want to reminisce about the
      foreign aid we used to send out?
      <a href="http://assistance.gov">Foreign Assistance.gov</a> lets anyone
      search by region, agency, or personal grievance. As much as those on the
      right like to complain about the supposed lack of transparency in our
      government, it’s not because the information isn’t readily available, it’s
      that it’s complicated and takes a while to put together. However, if you
      want to motivate people to start, digitally overthrowing the government
      certainly works for some.

      Elon’s response to this is to <s>be maximally transparent</s> make it
      harder to find his errors at all. Before, the Wall of Receipts had enough
      identifying information that users could search through the federal
      databases to confirm that his receipts were false. The newest batch of
      receipts no longer include that identifying information and when the
      <a

        >NY Times</a
      >
      found the information still in publicly available source code, DOGE
      scrubbed that as well. Elon has fully evolved to the “trust me bro” level
      of accountability.
    </p>

      Of, course, there is quite a bit of wheeling and dealing over what
      actually ends up getting cut, so that makes things hard. Lawmakers in
      Congress aren’t given any sorts of heads up before the cuts hit their
      district. Republicans talk a good game in public, but when you look at the
      numbers, red states are more reliant on federal money and are generally in
      areas with more federal workers. Outside of

        >privately use their access to secure relief</a
      >
      for their districts. It’s the reverse of Republicans voting against
      Infrastructure bills while also claiming credit for the projects that bill
      funded for in their election ads and ribbon cutting ceremonies. And the
      Democrats?

      In other attempts to hide their work this week, the Government argued in
      court that DOGE wasn’t subject to FOIA, because they were an “advisory
      department.” Such entities are allowed to avoid such laws because their
      role is advising the president and not doing. But DOGE is doing and a
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-says-musks-doge-must-release-records-operations-run-secrecy-2025-03-11/"
        >US District Judge</a
      >
      said they were probably subject to FOIA, so they needed to prep their
      records. In another federal lawsuit, the judge ruled that Musk and DOGE
      are
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/us/politics/elon-musk-doge-records-questioning.html?searchResultPosition=6"
        >absolutely subject to discovery</a
      >
      and must provide documents and answer questions about their mass firings
      (that they said last week <em>they actually</em> didn’t do). Another judge
      ordered the probationary employees
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/us-judge-extend-block-trump-administration-ordering-mass-firings-2025-03-13/"
        >fired be reinstated</a
      >, but an appeal is likely there.
    </p>

      However, the courts are slow and the Dems have no power. The Republicans
      of Kentucky are putting up an interesting show of selective disagreement.
      Of course, Mitch McConnell sorted out his conscience just in time to
      announce his retirement. No surprise there, and if he survives to 2026,
      I’m sure he longs to be the Republican shaking his cane at Trump.
      Meanwhile, Thomas Massey broke with Republicans on their Continuing
      Resolution to fund the government, which is his typical principled
      stance—to which, Trump is now
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/03/11/thomas-massie-trump-primary-spending-00225423"
        >threatening to primary him</a
      >. Ron Paul also looked to force a vote to
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/12/congress/gop-senators-support-doge-rand-paul-vote-00227215"
        >codify the cuts</a
      >
      at USAID. Partly because he wants his Republican Colleagues on
      record—knowing full well they won’t vote to make the cuts if it’s on them.
    </p>

    <p>
      And this all comes back to the game being played. All the people that
      claim to want these cuts, don’t want the consequences of these cuts. And
      really, when they say they want these cuts, it really means they want
      <em>someone else’s</em> stuff cut. None of this is about fiscal
      responsibility, transparency, or accountability. In fact, they weaponized
      all those things against the federal government that was trying to meet
      those standards. The people pushing these cuts aren’t going to feel the
      consequences and they are lying to the people that will.
    </p>

    <p>
      DOGE and Elon are the latest examples of how bad faith actors manipulate
      the system, bend the truth, and dodge accountability while pretending to
      serve a noble cause to further distract and lie. The courts are doing what
      they can, but they are subject to the same overton window that shapes
      public debate. A few hours ago, the Dems agreed to pass the Republican CR.
      They reasoned, allowing the government to shut down would give Elon more
      ability to disseminate the institutions. Maybe they are right, but
      somehow, the incentives have to change. Being the grown up in the room
      doesn’t work if the other side never has to grow up at all.
