      On Saturday morning, Donald Trump signed into law legislation that funds
      the government through the end of September, officially putting a bow on a
      tumultuous session that left Democrats divided on how to move forward and
      Republicans giddy over the continued dismantling of our government. Before
      diving too far into opinions, let’s take a look at the facts surrounding
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/119/bills/hr1968/BILLS-119hr1968ih.pdf"
        >H.R 1968</a
      >.

      Tom Cole (R-OK) stated
      <a
        href="https://appropriations.house.gov/news/remarks/cole-floor-remarks-hr-1968-full-year-continuing-appropriations-and-extensions-act-2025"
        >“(H.R. 1968) does not contain a single poison pill policy rider. It is
        a clean CR, fully funding our government.”</a
      >
      Typically, a clean bill means a bill that keeps government spending levels
      steady, which would allow time for the appropriations process to play out.
      By this standard, HR 1968 is not clean. It adds 6 billion to defense
      spending, and cuts 13 billion from domestic programs. Cuts to programs
      include 280 million from the National Institute of Health (cancer
      research, Alzheimer’s, heart disease, etc.), $30 million to the rural
      broadband Community Connect program (internet access for rural areas) and
      over
      <a

        >$700 million from various rent subsidies and homeless response grants
        for working people</a
      >. It also limits spending in DC to fiscal year 2024 spending levels. This
      effectively cuts 1.1 billion from DC’s budget for no discernable reason,
      although
      <a
        href="https://www.nbcwashington.com/news/president-trump-politics/senate-continuing-resolution-dc-funding/3868426/"
        >apparently Trump and the author of the bill Tom Cole both endorse
        rectifying this</a
      >. (OPINION:
      <a
        href="https://www.slowboring.com/p/sixteen-thoughts-on-an-averted-shutdown"
        >“I’m now roughly 70 percent sure they put it in just to create a
        hothouse environment among Democratic Party staffers and bait the Senate
        into a shutdown.”</a
      >

    <p>
      While budget cuts are on democrats minds, the things left unsaid in this
      budget have drawn criticism as well. HR 1968 removes all earmarks from the
      budget, which are how Congress specifically directs funds to certain
      projects. For example, a USAID budget of 40 billion dollars might include
      an earmark setting aside 1 billion of that for building water wells in the
      Sahara. Removing the earmark doesn’t mean the USAID budget is 39 billion,
      it means that whoever controls the USAID now has the discretion to spend
      that 1 billion however they see fit. It also now codifies a lot of the
      cuts DOGE has done, like the cuts to the NIH for example.

        >Judges have ruled these cuts are illegal</a
      >
      because Congress is the purse holder in our government, so this is
      Congress essentially approving these cuts after the fact. As AOC said;
      <a
        href="https://www.the-independent.com/news/world/americas/us-politics/chuck-schumer-aoc-cnn-interview-b2715062.html"
        >“This continuing resolution codifies much of this chaos that Elon Musk
        is wreaking havoc on the federal government. It codifies many of those
        changes,”</a
      >
      and
      <a
        href="https://www.huffpost.com/entry/aoc-chuck-schumer-advance-gop-funding-bill-government-shutdown_n_67d39830e4b036ac32ca0a22"
        >“This turns the federal government into a slush fund for Donald Trump
        and Elon Musk,”.</a
      >
      Couple all of these reasons along with the fact that
      <a
        href="https://tax.thomsonreuters.com/news/house-passes-budget-cr-in-final-days-before-shutdown/"
        >Democrats weren’t involved in the negotiation process</a
      >, and it’s no surprise why everyone House Democrat except one (shoutout
      <a href="https://jaredgoldenforcongress.com/">Jared Golden</a>) voted
      against the bill on March 11th.
    </p>

    <p>
      The following day, March 12th, Minority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY) spoke
      to the press and said Senate Democrats would NOT pass the bill.
      <a
        href="https://abcnews.go.com/Politics/schumer-democrats-block-house-funding-bill-heightening-shutdown/story?id=119716576"
        >“Our caucus is unified on a clean April 11 CR that will keep the
        government open and give Congress time to negotiate bipartisan
        legislation that can pass,”</a
      >
      Schumer said. But it still wasn’t certain if democrats would actually shut
      down the government.
      <a
        href="https://thehill.com/homenews/senate/5189724-senate-democrats-government-funding-shutdown/"
        >“The CR is a terrible bill … but a shutdown has terrible
        consequences,”</a
      >
      Said an anonymous Democratic Senator. “Elon Musk is trying to shut down
      the government. If we shut down the government, it takes the blame away
      from him and it puts the blame on us for chaos and confusion.” Talks would
      continue, and opinions would change.
    </p>

    <p>
      Thursday March 13th, Chuck Schumer came out and said
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/03/13/opinion/trump-musk-shutdown-senate.html"
        >he WOULD vote to pass the bill</a
      >. “For sure, the Republican bill is a terrible option. It is deeply
      partisan. It doesn’t address this country’s needs. But even if the White
      House says differently, Mr. Trump and Elon Musk want a shutdown. We should
      not give them one. The risk of allowing the president to take even more
      power via a government shutdown is a much worse path.” Schumer cites 4
      reasons for his decision;
    </p>

    <ol>
      <li>
        A shutdown would speed up DOGE’s destruction of the government. Trump
        would be the one to determine which agencies are “essential” and can
        remain open, and the others he could furlough with no promise of
        re-hiring once the government opens again.
      </li>
      <li>
        “if we enter a shutdown, congressional Republicans could weaponize their
        majorities to cherry-pick which parts of government to reopen.In a
        protracted shutdown, House and Senate Republicans could bring bills to
        the floor to reopen only their favored departments and agencies while
        leaving other vital services that they don’t like to languish.”
      </li>
      <li>Shutdowns suck for real, everyday americans.</li>
      <li>
        Donald Trump would have another distraction to keep eyes away from his
        awful agenda.
      </li>
    </ol>

    <p>
      Schumer also states that Republicans wanted a shutdown,
      <a
        href="https://www.wired.com/story/elon-musk-has-wanted-the-government-shut-down/"
        >citing reports that Elon Musk wanted</a
      >
      to go against the White House’s stated position. Some have speculated that
      there is some sort of “back-door” deal Schumer got, but I’ve yet to see
      any credible reporting asserting this to be true.
    </p>

    <p>
      While Donald Trump took to social media to praise Schumer’s “<a
        href="https://www.politico.com/live-updates/2025/03/14/congress/trump-congratulates-schumer-00230577"
        >guts and courage</a
      >”, Democrats were less enthused. Nancy Pelosi released a statement saying
      “<a
        href="https://pelosi.house.gov/news/press-releases/pelosi-statement-government-funding-bill-senate"
        >We must fight back for a better way. Listen to the women, For The
        People,</a
      >” praising Patty Murray and Rosa DeLauro for presenting the case against
      the bill as Appropriations leaders. AOC continued this trend,
      <a
        href="https://www.8newsnow.com/news/national-news/aoc-schumers-intent-to-vote-for-budget-bill-a-slap-in-the-face/"
        >harshly criticizing Schumer to the media</a
      >. “I cannot underscore enough how incorrect that is if they vote for the
      CR (continuing resolution),” Ocasio-Cortez told NewsNation. “… I think it
      is a huge slap in the face, and I think that there’s a wide sense of
      betrayal if things proceed as currently planned.” Ultimately, despite the
      backlash, Schumer voted to pass the bill along with; Catherine Cortez
      Masto (NV), Dick Durbin (IL), John Fetterman (PA), Kirsten Gillebrand
      (NY), Maggie Hassan (NH), Angus King (ME), Gary Peters (MI), Brian Schatz
      (HI), and Jeanna Shaheen (NH).

      While the vote was over, the discourse was not. “<a
        href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/03/15/politics/schumer-democrats-faith-spending-bill/index.html"
        >CNN’s conversations with three-dozen Democratic senators</a
      >, members of the House, top aides and other prominent leaders detail a
      cratering of support, with many starting to feel that he can’t be the
      party’s future and shouldn’t be their present.” This has been echoed by
      people such as Bernie Sanders, who stated this situation “was an absolute
      failure of democratic leadership.” Freshman Senator Adam Schiff called it
      “a bad day for our country – and for the Democratic Party.” Calls for
      Schumer to be primaried by AOC have been loud, and although the young
      representative hasn’t commented on her future plans, she was crystal clear
      in her criticisms.
