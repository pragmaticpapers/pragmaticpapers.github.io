      Political action articles will loosely alternate between philosophical and
      concretely instructional. This article focuses on emails to peers, but
      most of the lessons can be extrapolated out to any outreach email. Future
      articles may focus on candidate outreach.

    <p>First, let’s look over an example of a good outreach email:</p>

    <p>
      <samp>Hey JaneDoe!</samp><br />

      <samp
        >Was great meeting you at the 50501 protest last week! I’m working with
        Westchester Democrats United to organize a high-visibility trash cleanup
        on February 12th, to demonstrate Dems willingness to benefit the
        community wherever we can.</samp
      ><br />

      <samp
        >We are talking to some funders who might support more of these events
        if we generate enough media buzz, so it’s crazy important that we pull
        numbers for this one - it would be a huge help to have you. If you’re
        interested, (this signup link) has all the information in it. Feel free
        to share it around, and lemmy know if you have any questions!</samp
      ><br />

      <samp>Oh, and we’ll have pizza 😎</samp><br />

      <samp>Hoping to see you soon!</samp><br />

    <h3>Key elements of a great outreach</h4>

    <p>
      <strong>Context:</strong> We make clear who we are and what we are doing
    </p>
    <p>
      <strong>Ask:</strong> We make clear exactly what we need from them: Show
      up to our event
    </p>
    <p><strong>Concrete next step:</strong> Click the signup link</p>
    <p>
      <strong>Urgency:</strong> The most important element, and one that is
      often missing. People don’t want to feel like a drop in the bucket, or
      that they are a million steps away from a milestone. There is always a
      goal you will be working towards as an organizer: Building a community,
      Funding, Out-competing another organizing group, etc. Always highlight and
      focus on that next goal. In our example, we highlighted our goal of
      pulling in funding to scale this model.
    </p>

    <p>
      Additional bonus elements we include are highlighting our existing
      connection, keeping things brief and dense, keeping the tone friendly and
      casual since we are talking to a peer we have some connection with, and
      also pizza. Pizza is always a great hook if you can swing it!
    </p>

    <p>
      Here is a less ideal outreach email, with a few of these above elements
      missing. To graduate, think about which ones are missing and how you could
      improve this email.

      <samp>Hey JohnDoe! </samp><br />

      <samp
        >Sup, I'm participating in a trash cleanup event with Westchester
        Democrats United to demonstrate Dems willingness to benefit the
        community wherever we can. Should be fun, we are trying to get some
        social media buzz going, people do like their trash cleanups. </samp
      ><br />

      <samp
        >Let me know if you want to swing by - lots of cool folks coming, should
        be a good time. </samp
      ><br />

      <samp>Oh, and there will be NO PIZZA, you stupid #$1ing ^@#@% 😡😡😡</samp
