    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

      14223 – Addressing the Threat to National Security from Imports of Timber,
      Lumber and Their Derivative Products
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a

        >full text</a
      >, signed March 1, 2025, published March 6, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      The preface of this EO evokes
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/STATUTE-76/pdf/STATUTE-76-Pg872.pdf"
        >Section 232 of the Trade Expansion Act</a
      >. This act and its relevance are discussed in the previous week’s
      Executive Order Weekly Report regarding
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-28/pdf/2025-03439.pdf"
        >EO 14220</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>Section 1–3 are a timber/lumber themed version of EO 14220.</p>

    <p>
      Section 4 delineates timber and lumber as not processed and processed
      respectively.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      As with EO 14220, this honestly could have been an email, it is just
      directing executive branch staff to perform a function. However, it is
      important to read this EO with EO 14226 to understand how it will be used
      to impact American and Canadian lumber/timber production. Both EOs will be
      discussed further under EO 14226 below.

    <h3>
      14224 – Designating English as the Official Language of the United States
    </h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-06/pdf/2025-03694.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 1, 2025, published March 6, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 gives a vague history of English being used as the national
      language of the United States. This goes on for a while.
    </p>

    <p>Section 2 is some standard definitions of “Agency” and “Agency Head.”</p>

    <p>
      Section 3 designates English as the official language of the United
      States. It also revokes
      <a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2000/08/16/00-20938/improving-access-to-services-for-persons-with-limited-english-proficiency"
        >EO 13166</a
      >, without affecting services being provided by agencies, and revokes any
      guidance related to EO 13166.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO on its face simply does as it says and makes English the official
      language of the United States. Government designated official languages
      are common throughout the world. The best reading of why a country might
      implement an official language is that there are a number of commonly used
      languages amongst the population, these languages are used interchangeably
      without consistency, and such inconsistency leads to issues within the
      nation. This is why many African nations have made French or English an
      official language (it is important to note that in most of these nations,
      a local, or multiple local languages, are also official languages), as
      both languages are widely spoken by different ethnicities that have
      separate languages. Additionally, the adoption of these languages doesn’t
      require the rapid development of new words within languages that have not
      been used within government, business, or other modern institutions.
    </p>

    <p>
      As one may suspect after the previous example, official languages are
      incredibly political and are often implemented for hegemonic or even
      ethnic cleansing goals. Russia and other colonial powers have outlawed the
      use of native languages in their colonies and subjects under the guise of
      official language laws. Such enforcement of language stretches back
      through human history, and to list them all would not be helpful here.
    </p>

    <p>
      In a modern American context, an official language is far more likely
      being implemented for cultural rather than logistical reasons. Federal,
      state, and local governments operate almost entirely in the English
      language and provide all public facing communications in English. While
      the United States is a multi-cultural society of immigrants, with a
      multitude of languages, it would be difficult to identify societal issues
      stemming from these different languages.
    </p>

    <p>
      Looking to the text of the EO, section 1 touches on the history of the
      nation and unity amongst citizens. While there is language as to how a
      single language is efficient and consistent, the stability derived from
      the official language would be from a standardization of American culture
      and experience. Further, it focuses on benefiting those who conform to a
      monoculture.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      The designation of an official language will likely have little effect.
      Hidden within the EO is the revocation of EO 13166, and a direct attack on
      government benefits and services provided to non-native English speakers.
      EO 13166 focuses on increasing accessibility to government services to
      people who have limited English proficiency (LEPs). It ensures that
      government agencies provide alternate language materials to LEPs and take
      steps to prevent their agency from withholding services that would have
      otherwise been provided to an LEP only on the basis of their language
      abilities. Dismantling this EO now means that LEPs (overwhelmingly
      immigrants) will inevitably receive fewer government benefits and
      services.

    <h3>14225 – Immediate Expansion of American Timber Production</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-06/pdf/2025-03695.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >, signed March 1, 2025, published March 6, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 is a truncated version of Section 1 of EO 14223 plus some
      complaining about federal regulations.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 2 orders the Secretary of Agriculture to coordinate with other
      agency heads to issue guidance to facilitate increased timber production
      within 30 days. It also orders the Secretary of the Interior to improve
      the speed of approving forestry projects within 60 days. Finally, the two
      Secretaries within 90 days are to submit to the president a plan to set
      targets for more timber production from federal lands. Finally, it has a
      number of deadlines for new regulations regarding timber and its domestic
      exploitation.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 3 directs agencies to eliminate undue delays in approving permits
      for timber production.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 4 appears to show deference to the Endangered Species Act and its
      corresponding Committee, while also demanding they identify what parts of
      the ESA hinder timber production.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      The United States owns a significant amount of wooded land that is either
      protected or not actively logged. This EO likely will now allow American
      logging companies to bid for new contracts with the American government.
      While this may stimulate, or even subsidize, growth in the American
      logging industry, the clear cutting of these forests will likely have far
      reaching negative effects. When combined with EO 14224 the Administration
      is taking action regarding both imports and government assets in regards
      to timber and lumber production.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      While this and EO 14224 are signals to the Administration’s
      pro-isolationist base, they also set up for a windfall for logging
      companies in the United States. As with copper, I do not have the
      knowledge to speak about timber or lumber markets and industry to provide
      a meaningful commentary. I will direct you to two different articles
      <a
        href="https://earthjustice.org/press/2025/earthjustice-responds-to-executive-order-targeting-forests"
        >1</a
      >,
      <a
        href="https://www.kplctv.com/2025/03/07/timber-industry-optimistic-about-trump-administrations-executive-order/"
        >2</a
      >
      for such analysis, though this is only a sampling of the myriad opinions
      and perspectives on these EOs.
    </p>

    <p>
      In more speculative discussion, these EOs serve multiple purposes for the
      Administration. The aforementioned virtue signaling to the isolationist
      base, the “fulfilling of promises” regarding tariffs, and potentially the
      punishing of Canada. The Administration’s interest in economic dominance,
      to the point of conquest, of Canada has been explicit since before Donald
      Trump took office. Timber is a primary import from Canada to America,
      while America will suffer greatly by any restriction on imports, Canada
      will suffer as well. The opening of fresh logging on lands owned by the
      Government will undoubtedly boost American logging companies, though if it
      will be sufficient to fulfill American lumber needs is suspect. These two
      EO’s will put serious economic pressure on Canada, not only by potential
      tariffs but by a stronger American logging industry.

    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      The preface of this EO invokes the
      <a
        href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82"
        >International Economic Powers Act</a
      >,

        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&edition=prelim"
        >the National Emergencies Act</a
      >, section
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title19/chapter12&edition=prelim"
        >604 of the Trade Act of 1974</a

        >3 USC Section 301</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Section 1 amends
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-02-07/pdf/2025-02406.pdf"
        >EO 14193</a
      >
      section 2(h) regarding the Duty-free <em>de minimis</em> treatment under
      19 U.S.C. 1321.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This is a pretty precise change to the sweeping tariffs introduced against
      Canada. It essentially allows duty free imports of commodities in
      quantities under $800.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      It’s likely that this was changed to avoid any public backlash by an
      average person. Preventing duty free importing would probably be one of
      the only ways that an average person might actually experience a direct
      negative feeling from the tariffs that could be easily directed at the
      administration.
    </p>

    <p>
      While almost inconsequential on its face, this EO does provide a small
      insight into the Administration. They are taking precise and intentional
      measures to make their actions less personal to their supporters. It shows
      that to some degree, they still care about public opinion, and will adjust
      to please it.

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>The preface of this EO evokes the same laws as the previous two EOs.</p>

    <p>
      Section 1 gets mad at the People’s Republic of China for not reducing
      fentanyl and other drugs being shipped into America.

      to increase from a 10% to a 20% tariff on Chinese goods.
    </p>

    <h4>What It Means</h4>

    <p>
      This EO is pretty straightforwardly about increasing the tariff on Chinese
      goods from 10 to 20%.
    </p>

    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>

    <p>
      While trump appears to be playing hardball with China, it is interesting
      to see that even after this escalation, our tariffs on China are lower
      than those on our allies. The PRC’s response to the Administration’s
      tariffs has been vocal, but predictable. I would not be surprised if we
      don’t see some well executed diplomacy and flattery from Xi Jinping
      towards Donald Trump that results in a capitulation of the tariffs, for
      little to no concessions.
