    <p>
      On Saturday morning, Donald Trump signed into law legislation that funds
      the government through the end of September, officially putting a bow on a
      tumultuous session that left Democrats divided on how to move forward and
      Republicans giddy over the continued dismantling of our government. Chuck
      Schumer drew criticism after a change of heart on how to proceed in a

        Israeli airstrike in Beit Lahiya, northern Gaza Strip on Saturday. The
        Israeli military says it was targeting “terrorists” operating a drone in
        the area. But the head of Gaza’s civil defense, Mahmoud Basal, says they
        were aid workers from the London-based Al Khair Foundation, along with
        two journalists working with the group. &copy; Jehad Alshrafi/AP.</span

    <h3>Ceasefire in Gaza in jeopardy as Israel strikes</h3>

    <p>
      I’ve seen your comments, and I’ve wanted to write up on Israel Vs.
      Palestine. Unfortunately, with significant updates happening in the last
      24 hours and my already limited knowledge of the conflict, the summary I
      had written up felt insufficient. Rather than release subpar work, I’m
      going to link some articles detailing the developments over the past week,
      from a variety of sources. We will include a full piece next week, but if
      you’d like to submit one you can DM me on Reddit or @ThaManimal on
      Discord.
