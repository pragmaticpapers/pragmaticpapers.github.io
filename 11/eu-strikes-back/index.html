        signaling a tougher stance while still leaving room for negotiation.</em
      >
    </p>
    <p>
      On Thursday, Europe struck back in the ongoing trade dispute. EU trade
      officials unveiled a more than 200 page catalog of more than 4,800 goods
      in response to Washington’s recent slew of tariffs. The list includes food
      items such as meats, soybeans, and alcohol to plastics, medical devices,
      and passenger cars. They are also eyeing scrap metal and chemicals used in
      food processing. These tariffs amount to around 107 billion dollars worth
      of goods; notably lesser than the 379 billion put in place by the Trump
      administration. No specific rate for the tariffs was mentioned.
    </p>
    <p>
      According to Ursula von der Leyen, the goal is to facilitate negotiated
      outcomes with the US.
      <em
        >“We believe there are good deals to be made for the benefit of
        consumers and businesses on both sides of the Atlantic,”</em
      >
      She said in the
      <a href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/da/ip_25_1149"
        >statement</a
      >.
      <em>“At the same time, we continue preparing for all possibilities.” </em>
    </p>
    <p>
      Alongside the tariffs, the EU plans to initiate a dispute in the World
      Trade Organization, over the US’s blanket tariffs and the tariffs on car
      parts. The aim of the EU is
      <em
        >“to reaffirm that internationally agreed rules matter and cannot be
        unilaterally disregarded by any WTO member, including the US.” </em
      >. They also vowed to
      <em
        >“... continue negotiations with other trade partners to identify new
        export markets and diversify supply sources” </em
      >. Consultation for these tariffs will remain open until June 10th, giving
      Washington a month to respond.
    </p>
    <p>
      The move comes amidst the realization that there is no returning to the
      status quo with the US. Trump has gone back on his word numerous times,
      and seemingly backed down. He reduced the 20% blanket tariff rate to 10%,
      and added a 90 day moratorium on all tariffs, which signaled to Europe a
      willingness to negotiate. Now, almost 60 days out from it, the truth is
      beginning to dawn on European policymakers that it is very likely the
      administration will not be backing down completely.

      Europe has long needed to show strength against the bullying tactics of
      the Trump administration. A desperate clinging to the old order is not the
      answer; it will simply signal to Washington that Europe is willing to get
      hit, and not hit back. The mentality in Europe is beginning to change, and
      a more aggressive posture is being taken.

        deal”, </em
      >a senior European Commission official said. This shows the renewed
      resolve of the Commission, a clear step back from the capitulation and ego
      preserving tactics they had taken prior.

      But an eye for an eye style diplomacy could hurt both sides. A spiraling
      trade war between Europe and the US would lead to a disaster for both
      industries, something Europe would be wise to avoid.
      <a
        href="https://www.bruegel.org/analysis/economic-impact-trumps-tariffs-europe-initial-assessment#:~:text=Figure%202:%20Long%2Drun%20impact%20estimates%20of%20tariff,decline%20for%20EU%20exports%20to%20the%20US."
        >Economists warn</a
      >
      that a full-blown trade war could drive up prices for consumers, disrupt
      supply chains, and reduce export competitiveness. For example, increased
      tariffs on soybeans could hurt European livestock farmers dependent on
      U.S. imports, while U.S. automakers and alcohol distillers might face
      higher costs due to retaliatory tariffs on car parts and bourbon
      respectively. <br /><br />The Trump administration is already eyeing
      additional tariffs on lumber, trucks, and semiconductors. Thus, Europe
      also offered to increase LNG imports, zero for zero tariffs on car parts
      and industrial goods, and cooperation on AI. Offering Washington a carrot
      while wielding the stick is well planned diplomacy, giving Trump an
      offramp to de-escalate the trade tensions, while handing him a win he can
      deliver to his base. Within Europe, the move also serves domestic
      political purposes. As nationalist parties grow louder in some member
      states, EU leaders are under pressure to demonstrate that they can stand
      up to U.S. pressure without fracturing internal unity.
    </p>
    <p>
      What the President really wants is a headline he can sell. A “deal” with
      Europe, no matter how hollow, gives him a win to parade. His base isn’t
      interested in policy nuance. Trump is an influencer, and they want a
      show.. Hand them a bold slogan and a photo op, and the details can rot in
      the footnotes.
    </p>
    <p>
      If both sides find common ground, this episode could set the stage for a
      more balanced transatlantic trade framework. However, if rhetoric
      escalates and retaliations deepen,it could undermine trust between two of
      the world’s largest trading blocs at a time when geopolitical unity is
      sorely needed.
