      <a

        >Vladimir Putin</a
      >
      made some bold claims on Russian state television, perhaps energized by
      marking 25 years in power. Putin insisted Russia has ample “strength and
      means” to end the war in Ukraine, even stating he hopes he “will not need”
      to resort to nuclear weapons. This comes after having again just asked
      Ukraine to agree to a brief ceasefire for his Victory Day parades that
      would be taking place this Friday. Meanwhile,

        >Ukraine achieved a significant military milestone</a
      >
      the day prior that received little coverage at the time: Ukrainian forces
      successfully downed a Russian fighter jet using an unmanned naval drone,
      the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MAGURA_V5">MAGURA V5</a>, near
      Novorossiysk in the Black Sea. Russia was reluctant to confirm this, but
      many Russian milbloggers were quick to let out their frustration at this
      event, seeing as this same type of drone had also previously destroyed a
      helicopter a few months ago near Crimea.

      On Monday, May 5th,<a

      >
        President Trump made another bold claim</a
      >
      that makes me question whether even his own advisors are paying attention,
      stating that Russia and Ukraine are now inclined to settle the war, with
      Russia supposedly ready, due to falling oil prices and a weakened economy.
      Trump even pointed to Putin’s request for a three-day ceasefire during
      Moscow’s upcoming Victory Day parades as proof, conveniently ignoring that
      Putin outright rejected Zelenskyy’s proposal for a full 30-day ceasefire.
      Meanwhile, in Prague, President Zelenskyy secured another major boost to
      Ukraine’s military:

        >a Czech-led initiative</a

      to deliver 3 million artillery shells by the end of 2025, along with an
      expanded F-16 pilot training program.

        >Ukrainian Troops</a
      >
      also managed to go back on the offensive near Tetkino, Kursk Oblast,
      perhaps due to troops and equipment being pulled back in Russia for
      support in Putin's Parade.

        >Ukraine ramped up its pressure campaign inside Russia’s borders</a
      >, launching drone strikes that temporarily shut down over a dozen Russian
      airports, including four in Moscow. While no casualties were reported from
      the capital, damage to infrastructure and apartment buildings stirred
      panic just days ahead of Russia’s massive Victory Day parade.
      <a
        href="https://understandingwar.org/backgrounder/russian-offensive-campaign-assessment-may-6-2025"
        >Ukrainian forces also kept up their limited offensive</a
      >
      into Kursk and Belgorod oblasts, reportedly seizing ground near Tetkino
      and hammering Russian positions with artillery and JDAM strikes.
      Meanwhile, Russia tried to control the narrative at home. Shoigu published
      a sweeping op-ed casting the war in Ukraine as a spiritual successor to
      WWII, calling for a militarized, patriotic youth to carry on Russia’s
      “inevitable victory.”
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday, May 7th, the Trump administration surprised many by finally
      showing visible frustration with Moscow.
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/07/vance-munich-meeting-russia-ukraine-00332623"
        >Vice President JD Vance</a
      >
      stated that Russia is “asking for too much” in the ongoing ceasefire
      negotiations. Whether this signals that the administration is walking away
      from talks entirely remains to be seen. Meanwhile, Ukraine appears
      increasingly emboldened by Western support, launching deeper strikes into
      Russian territory both by air and on the ground. One loss that hit
      especially hard for those who’ve followed this war for some time was the
      death of
      <a

        >Chris “Swampy” Garrett</a
      >, a British volunteer and explosive ordnance disposal expert who was
      killed clearing mines in Izyum. Garrett had previously served in Myanmar,
      removing explosives for civilians, and had been doing the same in Ukraine
      since 2014. He even founded an organization called <em>Prevail</em>, which
      has helped train thousands and protect countless civilians. I never had
      the chance to speak with him personally, but I’ve crossed paths with
      volunteers who did, and by all accounts, he was the real deal hero through
      and through. This shit always hurts. I’m including this in the hope that
      anyone moved by his story might consider supporting
      <a href="https://www.prevailtogether.org/about"><em>Prevail</em> </a>and
      continuing the mission he gave his life to.

    <p>
      On Thursday, May 8th,
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/08/trump-russia-ukraine-ceasefire-00336934"
        >President Trump</a
      >
      formally called for a 30-day unconditional ceasefire in Ukraine, saying on
      Truth Social that he remains “committed” to peace and warning that new
      sanctions could follow if the pause isn’t respected. Ukraine backed the
      idea immediately as it was something Zelenskyy has been calling for, but
      also reported that Russia had already broken its own supposed 72-hour
      Victory Day ceasefire over
      <a
        href="https://thehill.com/homenews/ap/ap-international/ap-russia-attacks-ukraine-on-the-first-day-of-self-declared-ceasefire-killing-1-person/"
        >700 times</a
      >
      just in the first half of the day, with one strike in Sumy killing a
      civilian. On a brighter note for Kyiv, Ukraine’s parliament unanimously
      ratified the long-awaited rare earth minerals deal with the U.S., a major
      step forward that could finally give Trump and Zelenskyy some common
      ground. Meanwhile, in Moscow, Xi Jinping and a handful of other foreign
      leaders showed up for Putin’s parade, making it pretty clear where they
      stand in all this.

    <p>
      Friday, May 9th marked the 80th anniversary of Victory Day, Russia’s
      annual celebration of its defeat of Nazi Germany in World War II, which,
      in an inronic twist,
      <a

        >Putin used the parade to stoke nationalist pride</a
      >
      and justify his ongoing war on Ukraine and its culture. President Trump
      and leaders from Europe, including Macron, Starmer, and Merz,
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/09/world/trump-ukraine-russia-sanctions-allies-intl"
        >threatened fresh sanctions</a
      >
      if Russia didn’t agree to the 30-day ceasefire proposal that's been on the
      table for weeks. A summit in Lviv pulled in dozens of foreign delegations
      in support of the plan and even floated the creation of a special tribunal
      to prosecute Russian crimes of aggression. As Putin tried to showcase a
      united front on his home turf, complete with a PR parade featuring allied
      soldiers and red-flag-waving bombers, the reality of mounting pressure
      outside his borders seemed to finally be coming together.

        >European leaders rallied in Kyiv with Zelenskyy</a

      to finalize plans for the 30-day ceasefire proposed earlier in the week.
      While Russia staged its Victory Day spectacle in Moscow, Ukraine and its
      allies held a show of unity of their own, putting the ball firmly in the
      Kremlin’s court. With Macron, Starmer, Merz, and Tusk all backing the
      plan, the summit marked a rare moment of full transatlantic alignment. The
      message was clear: either Moscow agrees to the ceasefire or faces “massive
      sanctions” and deeper Western support for Ukraine. Europe now seems ready
      to step up—what remains to be seen is whether Trump will join them in
      turning up the pressure and keep up with his recent takes on Putin.
