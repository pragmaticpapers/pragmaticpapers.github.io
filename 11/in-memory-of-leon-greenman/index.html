    <p>
      One of the many good fortunes of my childhood was the contact I had with
      my parents’ acquaintances, who tended to be both inquisitive and inspiring
      by nature. My father, a teacher by profession, had been involved in the
      anti-racism movement from my earliest years and had become acquainted with
      Leon through such channels. By this point, Leon was utterly dedicated to
      sharing his experience of utmost tragedy-one that many sought to
      forget-and as such, he devoutly visited schools to speak. My father’s
      school was but one of many.
    </p>
    <p>
      Visiting Leon’s home is a poignant childhood memory. His office was a
      treasure trove of visual stimuli, wonderfully cluttered with books and
      papers. It was the room I remember most distinctly from his apartment
      during our visit, clearly the space in which he spent much of his time.
      What I failed to recognise at the time were the bars fitted to his
      windows, an eerie reminder of the death threats and vandalism committed
      against his home by the far right, who had already thrown bricks through
      his windows. Alas, the hatred of the "other" continued, and continues to
      live on.
    </p>
    <p>
      As we sat by his desk, I remember his gentle smile and warm demeanour
      toward me. Interestingly, this was a characteristic of Leon that many
      remember. It made the contrast all the starker when recollection
      began-like the darkest storm cloud on a warm summer’s day, intensely
      vivid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leon would often begin recalling his memories by highlighting the tattoo,
      the branding of the number scarred into his arm in Auschwitz. He refused
      to have it removed, as many had done. It was the harsh evidence he chose
      to carry with him, a burden he was willing to bear.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite being of British nationality, the draw of love had brought Leon to
      Rotterdam, where in 1940 he lived with his wife Esther and their newly
      born son, Barney. That same year, the Nazi invasion quickly reduced the
      British consulate to ruin, ridding Leon of his documents and the chance
      for him and his family to be evacuated.
    </p>
    <p>
      The noose of fascism tightens in increments, so as to be excused. This was
      no different under the Nazis. As such, and despite the war, Leon initially
      continued to be active as a salesman, while the Nazis implemented their
      derogatory, dehumanising laws-one by one. He would later regret not going
      into hiding and had underestimated the difficulty of returning to Britain
      as an undocumented migrant until it was too late.
    </p>
    <p>
      The deportations began at the end of 1942, with Leon and his family
      eventually arriving in Auschwitz in the midst of winter, crammed into
      cattle wagons. This was his final moment with his beloved wife Esther and
      son Barney, who were murdered in the camp. As the family was torn apart,
      the Nazi guards laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leon would recall the memories that haunted him the most. The veil of
      denial was lifted regarding Barney’s fate when he saw the pile of
      children’s shoes-this was the moment the horror of the camp, the
      industrialised murder, became fully apparent. Other memories included the
      perpetual stench from the crematoria, the vindictive beatings, and
      omnipresent fear.
    </p>
    <p>
      What makes Leon’s story so enduring isn’t only what he endured, but how he
      responded. Whilst caged, expecting death in the depths of this pinnacle of
      brutality, Leon prayed. He vowed that, if he survived, he would not stay
      silent, but inform and teach of the terrors that were imposed on so many.
      The abject suffering.
    </p>
    <p>
      In the aftermath of the war, Leon returned to England, moved to East
      London, and became a bookseller (His love for books was confirmed by the
      colossal book collection in his home). Alas, despite his vow, Leon
      remained relatively silent until the late 1970s. That decade saw the rise
      of the neo-Nazi movement in the UK-violent thuggery with a penchant for
      white nationalism and Holocaust denial. Leon could remain silent no
      longer.
    </p>
    <p>
      What Leon then became is the Leon that inspired me. Leon was driven to
      inform, speaking at many venues a week–schools, community centres,
      universities. He spoke in detail, vivid memories, with absolute clarity.
      Leon published his memoir, titled
      <strong><em>An Englishman in Auschwitz</em></strong
      >, in 2001, an act that ensured his testimony would endure not only
      through spoken word but in the permanence of the written page, a lasting
      record of truth against the erosion of memory and denial.
    </p>
    <p>
      Despite various death threats from the far right, Leon stood firm,
      becoming all the more driven. As an elderly man, hip replacements and ill
      health did not hinder his zeal. Leon remained actively engaged in
      Holocaust education and anti-fascist advocacy until shortly before his
      passing in 2008.
    </p>
    <p>
      At his funeral, Leon had left a final wish for us to hear, and to
      paraphrase: do not cry for me, but use that emotion, that energy, to
      inform.
