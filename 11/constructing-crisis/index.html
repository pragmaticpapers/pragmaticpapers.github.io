      I was watching the PBD episode with Sam Seder and the divergence of
      realities was stark. Sam was pointing out their misinformation when
      discussing immigration issues, such as when the PBD folks conflate asylum
      seekers or non-citizens with protected status with undocumented
      immigrants. The issuance of social security cards to these people for work
      purposes was framed as a covert effort to get them to vote, even though
      the cards they are issued explicitly state they cannot be used for voting
      purposes.
    </p>
    <p>
      When the conversation turned to DOGE and its claims of uncovering massive
      waste and fraud, Sam asked a simple question: “<em
        >What fraud was actually found?”</em
      >
      The response was exasperation, as if the answer was obvious—but no one
      ever gave one.
    </p>
    <p>
      So are these guys lying? That’s trickier than it seems. The media
      ecosystem they live in isn’t interested in verifying claims—or correcting
      them. And I can’t find where they engage with any of the counter-evidence
      either.
    </p>
    <h4>Truth for sale</h4>
    <p>
      Let's start with the issue that got the most attention, Social Security.
      Musk delighted the right media sphere when he said there were millions of
      extremely old people in the database and implied that these people were
      receiving benefits. This, of course, was quickly disputed. There are
      processes in place to ensure that those receiving benefits have their ID
      confirmed, are qualified for those benefits, and are, in fact, alive. So
      while there are lots of dead people on social security databases, that
      isn’t what’s used to send benefits, so simply being assigned a social
      security number doesn’t mean you are getting social security benefits.
      This should be common sense as there are several reasons actual citizens,
      who definitely have social security numbers, don’t qualify for benefits.
      So another process is required once a person seeks to collect.
    </p>
    <p>
      How was this presented in the conservative media sphere? I can’t find
      anything on Fox News reporting that last bit. There is an<a
        href="https://www.foxnews.com/opinion/sen-elizabeth-warren-social-security-under-attack-gutting-broken-promise"
      >
        op-ed from Senator Warren</a
      >
      that explains how Elon’s social security claims are incorrect and actually
      cites then Trump’s acting Social Security Commissioner that the claims
      were false, but it’s paid content.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is a video on Fox News about an interchange on CNN titled “<a
        href="https://www.foxnews.com/video/6369023144112"
        >Ex Social Security Official laughs at CNN Host’s questions about
        fraud</a
      >” which is a video of Martin O-Malley saying that DOGE has no idea what
      they are looking at, but just as O’Malley is probably going to explain
      what he means, the video cuts away to a still of Musk with a message that
      simply says “Elon Musk’s Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE)
      asserted that millions of people in the Social Security database were
      listed as over 100 years old.” So a frustrating sleight of hand–the claim
      is technically true, but not the fact anyone is disputing.
    </p>
    <p>
      Now, if you find the article on this video, it explains that O’Malley goes
      on to ask for Elon to provide the names of people that are dead and
      receiving checks. He confirms there are cases where folks try to game the
      system to keep collecting grandma’s checks, but due to other checks, they
      only get one or two before that is cut off. He also states that a bigger
      issue was people being erroneously marked as dead and having to go and
      correct for that error. Unfortunately, to get that part of the story, you
      have to have access to their paid content.
    </p>
    <p>
      In fact, this was a common issue I found. The free content on Fox News
      often had a headline or video clip that would seem supportive of Musk’s
      claims, but the actual story would be behind a paywall. Apparently, to get
      the truth at Fox News, you have to pay for it, but if you just want to get
      mad, well, that’s free.
    </p>
    <h4>Blurring the Lines</h4>
    <p>
      There are lots of ‘vibes’ in the air now. Lots of people feel bothered,
      but not really sure about what’s bothering them. The problem oftentimes is
      people don’t really do the necessary introspection to find the source of
      their concerns and may latch onto something that feels good. Everyone does
      this, but it seems to have festered on the right.
    </p>
    <p>
      In another
      <a
        href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/musk-shares-chart-millions-noncitizens-social-security-numbers-under-biden"
        >Fox News article</a
      >, and a highlight from the PBD podcast mentioned above, was a chart Elon
      presented showing the number of non-citizens that were given social
      security numbers during Biden’s term. He presented it as a side quest he
      stumbled on during his efforts to find fraud at the SSA. In the words of
      Antonio Gracias who was presenting with Elon, “This literally blew us
      away…we sent to find fraud and found this by accident.” The issue,
      according to them, was this was a sort of fraud or system misuse, giving
      all these non-citizens social security numbers. The puzzle fits very
      nicely in their story of immigrants being brought by Democrats for votes.
      The missing pieces? That these people can’t vote, don’t get social
      security benefits, even as they actively pay billions annually into the
      system they will not receive benefits from.

        >Other reports stated</a
      >
      that the non-citizens were granted these social security numbers through
      Biden’s immigration parole program and then went on to say that the
      numbers were fraudulent numbers and that these people were able to vote
      and receive Medicare benefits (but no evidence provided to confirm it).

        href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/musk-says-social-security-scammer-who-allegedly-ripped-off-400k-americans-faces-imminent-arrest"
        >According to Musk</a
      >, getting a social security number gets you de facto registered to vote
      and access to a whole host of benefits. Nowhere in my Fox News website
      search, did I find an article explaining how to get social security
      benefits or why non-citizens would get issued a social security number
      through completely legal means.
    </p>
    <p>
      There is also the go-to smear of calling Social Security a ponzi scheme.
      Based on the definition, it sort of sounds like it. Per the SEC, a ponzi
      scheme “<a
        href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/expert-turns-tables-dem-critics-after-musk-accused-social-security-ponzi-scheme"
        >operates by taking money from new investors to pay current investors</a
      >.” Except that isn’t the whole definition. The central point of a ponzi
      scheme is that investors are being deceived into thinking their investment
      is being put towards<a
        href="https://www.sec.gov/files/ia_virtualcurrencies.pdf"
      >
        opportunities that will generate high returns</a
      >. No one thinks their social security is being invested and in fact, past
      attempts to make social security function like that have been

        >overwhelmingly opposed by voters</a
      >. Again, tidbits, left out of the Republican narrative.
    </p>
    <h4>Cracks in the Narrative</h4>
    <p>
      Even with these half-truths, there is hesitation about DOGE’s methods.
      While the nuance is often left behind paywalls, even Fox captured the
      results of voters' concerns about DOGE. Again and again, voters have
      expressed support for making the government more efficient, but not in the
      way
      <a
        href="https://www.foxnews.com/politics/fox-news-poll-voters-have-concerns-about-doge-even-see-need-cuts"
        >DOGE goes about it.</a
      >
      At the end of the day, voters want more funding for programs like social
      security. One good thing about more working class voting republicans is
      that now those republicans have to cater to the programs that group wants,
      and they are much more likely to depend on things like social security.
      That shift is likely to lead all DOGEs efforts to ultimately being hollow
      and temporary because for these changes to survive the avalanche of court
      cases that stymie DOGE at every stop, they need legislation, and it’s not
      looking good.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/09/us/politics/medicaid-spending-republicans.html?searchResultPosition=10"
        >Reports are coming in about moderate republicans</a
      >
      in Congress who are putting the brakes on some of the ambitious cuts being
      pursued by DOGE and threatening Trump’s “Big Beautiful Bill” to extend his
      tax cuts and give DOGE some legislative cover. This isn’t just impacting
      government programs like Medicaid, but also the
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/judge-orders-temporary-halt-trump-administrations-mass-layoff-plans-2025-05-10/?utm_source=chatgpt.com"
        >reduction in workforce</a
      >
      that DOGE has been pursuing. They won’t have Democratic support, so any
      Republican defection is basically a deal killer, but vulnerable
      Republicans are putting up roadblocks.
    </p>
    <p>
      Also, the committees meant to provide oversight for DOGE activities are
      AWOL or turning into a sideshow. The DOGE House Oversight Committee
      recently held a hearing on…Transwomen in fencing competitions?? The
      committee hearing devolved into an opportunity for Rep.

      (D-NM) to ask what this had to do with DOGE.

    </div>
    <p>
      There is also a DOGE Caucus made up of over 80 bipartisan members of
      congress, but it’s only had 2 meetings. There has been<a
        href="https://www.businessinsider.com/doge-congress-subcommittee-caucus-rescissions-2025-5"
      >
        little interaction with administration</a
      >
      to move anything forward. Not surprising given Trump’s tendency to think
      he can go it alone. The courts may have something to say about that
      though.
    </p>
    <p>
      DOGE, for all its chaos, is built on a house of cards being guarded by a
      paper dragon. For any of the changes to survive the court challenges
      coming for it, Trump has to engage the rest of the government and convince
      his supporters to codify something–anything–into law. Like his first term,
      he is leaving them with nothing to build on.
    </p>
    <p>
      It's easy to get frustrated with conservatives we know because it seems
      like they are denying reality, but depending on their media of choice,
      they likely simply don’t know what’s going on. Trump was astoundingly
      ineffective during his first term, but that’s not the message they get.
    </p>
    <p>
      The right-wing media’s refusal to engage with facts isn’t just lazy, it’s
      strategic. They package half-truths behind paywalls and blur reality into
      vibes, leaving viewers angry, misinformed, and loyal. What they aren’t
      being told is that if Trump’s incomplete reality comes to fruition, the
      consequences will be stark—and we’ll all bear the cost. When it collapses
      under its own contradictions, the question isn’t <em>if</em> the PBD crew
      will notice. It’s whether they’ll keep editing reality mid-sentence just
      to avoid saying they were wrong.
