    <p>Imagine being a homeowner.</p>
    <p>
      Imagine having the city fine you because someone slipped on your sidewalk
      during the winter.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine having someone sue you because a branch from a tree fell off in
      your front yard and broke someone’s windshield parked on the side of the
      street.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine having a child in the neighborhood climb a fence and run into your
      yard and slip into your pool and die and being held liable for their
      death.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine financing a house in 2007 and having your entire financial life
      destroyed because you owe 3× more than the value of where you live.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine struggling to take out equity from your home when interest rates
      are rising to afford anything because your “most important investment
      vehicle” has zero liquidity.

    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine your local economy collapses and property values plummet and you
      are trapped forever unless you want to file bankruptcy to escape your
      rapidly depreciating asset.
    </p>
    <p>
      Imagine the sun setting on the day of the life of a mortgagoid, his brain
      racked with the stress of financial uncertainty and the mounting
      responsibilities every single day just to deal with his “dream home.”
      Tomorrow, he will walk into his basement, look at the floor in the corner
      of his laundry room, see cracks beginning to form, and kill himself.

      I wake up in the morning and yawn, raising my blinds and looking out to a
      freshly manicured garden, maintained by top-tier gardeners hired by my
      apartment complex (we’re vertical and population dense so we can spend
      more money than a homeowner would be able to).
    </p>
    <p>
      I walk out to my kitchen and grab a glass of water, then put it up to the
      fridge. Water comes out, but it’s a bit slow. I sigh, but for only a
      moment, worried that I would have to spend half of the day scheduling and
      contacting someone to come to my house to troubleshoot the refrigerator,
      but then I remember I live in an apartment, so I can simply put in a
      request with my apartment owner and have them deal with it.
    </p>
    <p>
      I go to the bathroom and turn on the shower. I stand under the hot water
      for 60 minutes, not for any real reason, but I relax under the nozzle
      comforted by the reality that I will never, ever run out of hot water
      because my building has an industrial sized water heater in the basement.
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather outside might take a turn for the worst, causing me to
      shudder, knowing it’s trash day and I have to journey out into the... oh
      no, wait, there is no “trash day”, I can simply walk out to my hallway and
      deposit my bag of trash into a chute where it will be taken care of by the
      contracted sanitation company.
    </p>
    <p>
      My local economy changes significantly throughout the last 2–3 years, with
      property values plunging. I smile to myself, opening an envelope from my
      leasing agent, offering me a $400/month rent decrease, knowing they have
      to stay competitive with market rates to prevent me from leaving.
    </p>
    <p>
      I pick up the phone and catch up with an old friend. He’s bragging about
      his recent home equity line of credit that he just took out to put a down
      payment on a new car, but cringes a bit when I ask him about the interest
      rate. I chuckle back at him, telling him I put a down payment on a similar
      (but better) car. He asked me how I came up with the money, and I told him
      I simply logged into my Robinhood account and sold off a few shares of a
      stock I owned, and we both share a laugh at how superior the liquidity of
      my assets are to his (single asset).

      I lay down, looking out the window of my apartment across the bay to the
      beautiful skyline, then realize I’m bored of this place and start looking
      for another apartment to move into for tomorrow. I have no realtor to
      call, no financing to worry about, and no bank to deal with as I close my
      eyes, imagining the new appliances and fresh coats of paint awaiting me in
      my future apartment unit.
