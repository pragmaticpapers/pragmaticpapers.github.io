    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>EO 14277 – Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for
      American Youth</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a

        >full text</a
      >; signed April 23, 2025; published April 28, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 has some broad language about how AI is important and the US
      should try to educate children about it.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states it is the policy of the US to teach AI literacy and
      proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3 defines AI for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 4 establishes an educational task force made up of a number of
      secretaries.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 creates a Presidential Artificial Intelligence Challenge to
      encourage education in AI.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 lays out how the task force is to help promote education with a
      focus on public-private agreements.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7 orders the Secretary of Education to prioritize teacher training
      in AI via grants.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8 orders the Secretary of Labor to focus on establishing AI
      related Apprenticeships.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      I don’t know much about AI, but this EO seems to reflect that neither does
      the Administration. It is incredibly vague and broad about its goals. It
      also just discusses things that don’t have a point of reference, what
      would the Presidential AI Challenge be? What is an AI-related
      apprenticeship?
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      This seems like a pretty ripe avenue for graft for tech companies and
      government contractors who wish to use AI as cover for appropriating
      government funds.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14278 – Preparing Americans for High-Paying Skilled
      Trade Jobs of the Future</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-28/pdf/2025-07369.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 23, 2025; published April 28, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 states it wants to streamline fragmented workforce development
      programs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states it is the policy of the US to optimize and target Federal
      investments in workforce development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders various Secretaries to review all Federal workforce
      development programs to consolidate and streamline them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders various Secretaries to develop a plan to reach and
      surpass 1 million new active apprenticeships.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders various Secretaries to improve transparency on
      performance outcomes of thes programs.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This appears to be a move to consolidate the various programs funded
      through various agencies under the Workforce Innovation and Opportunity
      Act (WIOA). Many of these programs are operated by the states and funded
      under this act. There are some that are national, and theoretically could
      be consolidated.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      While on its face this EO seems to be a positive in helping create more
      work opportunities. It more likely is simply virtue signaling to the
      right’s obsession with trade jobs and apprenticeships. This not so subtly
      continues in the Administration’s goal to undermine higher education.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14279 – Reforming Accreditation To Strengthen Higher
      Education</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-28/pdf/2025-07376.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 23, 2025; published April 28, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 disparages the Medical and Legal accreditation system in the US.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 order the Secretary of Education look for reasons to sue schools
      and accreditors that have DEI programs or standards.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 lays out new principles of accreditation that sets a list of
      standards for accreditation organizations to follow. This list includes
      promotion of intellectual diversity. This section also calls for
      recognizing additional accreditors to “increase competition and
      accountability”, and other measures to undermine them.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is a direct attack on the legal and medical education system in
      America. It is an attempt to control the ideology and remove the
      independence of these institutions. Accreditation is not only important to
      reflect whether a school is competent to produce doctors or lawyers, it is
      a prerequisite for receiving a federal student loan. This means that if a
      school loses accreditation, it will likely lose a significant amount of
      attendees and income.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is incredibly dangerous and will likely lead to a clash between
      the organizations and the government. This EO undermines higher education,
      student’s abilities to get federal student loans and grants, can be used
      by Trump to force schools to police the thoughts of their students and
      professors, and will exacerbate the lawyer and doctor shortage in America.

    <h3>EO 14280 – Reinstating Commonsense School Discipline
      Policies</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-28/pdf/2025-07377.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 23, 2025; published April 28, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 disparages concepts of equitable discipline in school. It
      complains of schools incorporating disparate impact analysis in their
      methods of discipline as were required under Obama and Biden.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 requires the Secretary of Education to issue new guidance for
      discipline that no longer uses disparate impact analysis.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      Disparate impact discipline is an analysis on a school’s forms of
      discipline to make sure that it does not overly punish different groups of
      students. This way discipline in schools is more fairly dispensed.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      This EO will likely allow for discipline in schools to negatively affect,
      most likely minority, children that attend. This is a virtue signal to the
      right as many blame the issue in American education on teachers’ ability
      to discipline children effectively.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14281 – Restoring Equality of Opportunity and
      Meritocracy</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-28/pdf/2025-07378.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 24, 2025; published April 29, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1, similar to the previous EO, complains of disparity impact
      liability, though this time it is applied to the application of law
      broadly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states that it is the policy of the US to eliminate the use of
      disparate-impact liability in all contexts
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 revokes a number of Presidential acts under
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/crs-product/IF11705"
        >Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders all agencies to no longer consider disparate-impact
      liability in their actions and enforcement of the law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders the AG to initiate appropriate action to repeal or amend
      regulations under Title VI of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 orders the AG and head of the EEOC to close all cases and
      investigations based on impact-disparate liability.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7 orders the AG and other agencies identify state laws that should
      be be preempted by federal law to no longer consider disparate-impact
      liability in there enforcement
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      Disparity-impact liability is when racial intent may not be present, but
      the enforcement or consequence of enforcement results in a disparate
      impact on individuals of a race, color, or national origin group.
    </p>
    <p>To find this there is a three part test:</p>
    <p>
      1. Disparate impact - does the effect fall on a group disproportionately?
    </p>
    <p>
      2. Justification - if so does the record establish substantially
      legitimate justification for the policy/practice?
    </p>
    <p>
      3. Less discriminatory alternative - is there an alternative that would
      achieve the same legitimate objective but with less of a discriminatory
      effect?
    </p>
    <p>
      This EO now orders the government to no longer consider or enforce this
      concept. Title VI guarantees equal distribution of government benefits
      based on race, color, or national origin group. This EO specifically
      targets this section.
    </p>

          >LBJ signs the Civil Rights Act of 1964</a
        ></span
      >
    </div>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      We will likely see government benefits and executive action having a
      greater impact in the white community and less impact in non-white
      communities. Interestingly, while the Executive can take this action, the
      EO by no means protects it from a private cause of action for such
      disparate impact liability. While these suits are rare, a person can sue
      the government for such a violation, and this EO explicitly orders the
      government to violate Title VI.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14285 – Unleashing America’s Offshore Critical Minerals
      and Resources</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-29/pdf/2025-07470.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 24, 2025; published April 29, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Section 1 talks about how great our offshore mineral resources are.</p>
    <p>
      Section 2 says it is the policy of the US to advance our capabilities and
      investments in seabed mineral development.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 directs various Secretaries to take steps to promote undersea
      mineral development.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO means what it says. It is trying to increase US offshore mining.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      Whether this EO is more than graft is yet to be seen. However, should the
      EO actually result in an increase in offshore mining, it is almost
      guaranteed to harm fisheries and other ecosystems without any regard as to
      the externalities that will result.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14286 – Enforcing Common Sense Rules of the Road for
      America’s Truck Drivers</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-02/pdf/2025-07786.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 28, 2025; published May 2, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 talks about how great truckers are and that laws for trucker
      safety should be followed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states it is the policy of the Administration to support
      truckers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of Transportation to create new guidance to
      require English proficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders the Secretary of Transportation to review state agency
      policies for issuing CDLs and to take action to ensure federal compliance.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders the Secretary of Transportation to identify additional
      actions to help truck drivers.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO focuses on English comprehension in Truckers, and standardization
      of licensure.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      While simple in purpose and goals this EO has two sinister implications.
      First it will likely reduce the amount of immigrant truck drivers, a
      significant portion of the trucker population. English proficiency is
      important, though the proficiency needed to operate an 18 wheeler and
      navigate a route in America is likely quite low. The other implication is
      in finding the other “actions to help truckers”. The Motor Carrier Act
      regulates almost all aspects of the business of trucking. While it may
      create some inefficiencies in the market, it almost entirely is because it
      prevents companies from abusing and taking advantage of truckers. It would
      be unsurprising if the Administration uses this EO as a foundation to
      attack this law, and promote the exploitation of American truckers.

    <h3>EO 14287 – Protecting American Communities From Criminal
      Aliens</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-02/pdf/2025-07789.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 28, 2025; published May 2, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 claims that the prior administration let in unchecked millions
      of undocumented aliens and that federal, state, and local officials are
      aiding them in avoiding deportation.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 orders the AG with the head of DHS to identify sanctuary
      jurisdictions and provide them notice of potential violations of federal
      criminal law.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the identification of federal benefits or funds being
      provided to these sanctuary jurisdictions. It also orders the AG and head
      of DHS to use all legal remedies to end the sanctuary status of these
      jurisdictions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders the creation of guidance to restrict federal benefits to
      individuals within a sanctuary jurisdiction.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders the AG and head of DHS to stop the application of laws
      that favor aliens in criminal charges and sentencing or that allow lower
      cost for instate tuition to aliens.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is yet another EO targeting sanctuary cities, counties, and states.
      It is an attempt to impose federal will onto state and local governments
      that otherwise are allowed to act in this manner.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      While there is no legitimate legal route to end sanctuary jurisdictions,
      withholding federal funds from these jurisdictions is possible now that
      the republican held congress has essentially ratified powers of
      impoundment. The withholding of federal benefits to individuals within a
      sanctuary jurisdiction is strictly illegal, and should not survive long in
      the courts. However, by imposing this pressure, it is possible that
      smaller or less resilient jurisdictions will willingly give up their
      sanctuary status and thus immigrants of all kinds within them will become
      vulnerable to this Administration.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14288 – Strengthening and Unleashing America’s Law
      Enforcement To Pursue Criminals and Protect Innocent Citizens</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-02/pdf/2025-07790.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >; signed April 28, 2025; published May 2, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>Section 1 hypes up law enforcement in America.</p>
    <p>
      Section 2 orders the AG to take the steps to provide more resources to
      help cops.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the AG to use federal resources to assist and protect law
      enforcement officers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders the increase in the sale of excess military assets to law
      enforcement. It also orders SecDef to coordinate with AG how the military
      can be used to combat crime.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 directs the AG to bring legal action against state and local
      officials who obstruct law enforcement officers and DEI initiatives.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 directs the AG and Secretary of Homeland Security to utilize the
      Homeland Security Task Forces to implement this order.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO yet again signals this Administration’s support of law
      enforcement. While military equipment has been given/sold to police
      departments for a while now, this EO will make such transfers easier. It
      also is one in a string of EOs that encourage the federal government to
      intervene in state matters. Section 4 is especially alarming considering
      the military is not allowed to act domestically, even in a law enforcement
      role. Section 5 is of note considering that the Administration has shown a
      propensity for arresting judges.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      This EO will likely suffer greatly in the courts, as it directly calls for
      multiple illegal actions. In the meantime it will likely be a pretext for
      the militarization of law enforcement. Additionally this EO signals
      strongly to bringing police and other law enforcement organizations under
      the command of the federal executive. Rather than being loyal to their
      city/county/state, this EO clearly intends for a centralization of command
      when it comes to law enforcement in America.

    <h3>EO 14289 – Addressing Certain Tariffs on Imported
      Articles</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a

        >full text</a
      >; signed April 28, 2025; published May 2, 2025)
    </div>

    <h4>Summary</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 admits that the Administration's multiple tariffs are confusing
      and overlap in ways that need clarity.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 identifies the tariffs that are being addressed.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 states that where the tariffs identified overlap, they are not
      additive.

      Section 4 says that this order doesn’t lower any of the tariffs identified
      on their own.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5 orders the guidance for these tariffs to be updated.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO clears up some, but not much, of the confusion around tariffs
      imposed by this Administration. The president has so wantonly applied
      tariffs to things, industries, and countries that it is hard to determine
      what a final tariffed amount is on a given item. This EO now tries to cut
      through this web of dementia based trade policy to tell us that tariffs
      are not additive and if multiple tariffs could apply to an imported good,
      only the highest would apply.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Forward</h4>
    <p>
      Technically this is a form of tariff relief in many ways. This
      Administration has little tact or plan when it comes to its tariffs so it
      is unsurprising to see overlap like this without guidance when it occurs.
      This EO is bordering on comedic considering how much it simply admits that
      this Administration is both incompetent and short sighted in its actions.
