    <p>
      Liberalism has been on a 250-year tear, proving itself to be the heart of
      any society hoping to maximize the prosperity of its people. Today, on the
      eve of the end of history, a bizarre menagerie of radicals,
      authoritarians, terrorists, evangelicals, and communists has united
      against us. For the first time in a generation, it can no longer be taken
      for granted that history will end with freedom’s ring sounding across the
      globe. We have rested on our laurels while our enemies clawed every day
      for survival. We are smarter, better, more numerous, and more aligned than
      any of them. Every advantage is in our corner – all we have left to do is
      fight.

    <h2>Editor’s Note</h2>

    <p>
      Due to popular request, we’ve changed the format of the newsletter a bit.
      This format is WAY less restrictive than a Reddit post, which enables us
      to do some cool things. This is a work in progress, so tell us what you
      think! We’re always looking to improve.
    </p>

    <p>
      Also, join the political action server! We managed to do a lot of cool
      stuff this past year, and we want to continue that momentum and channel
      our energy into something productive. Change starts with you, so come on
      in and let’s get COOKIN.
