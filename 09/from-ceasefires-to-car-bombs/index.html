      On Sunday, April 20th, Russia’s so-called “<a
        href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/czd3ge7j92zo"
        >Easter Truce</a
      >” officially went into effect, though many warned against placing any
      real trust in this performative gesture. Despite Putin’s announcement of a
      30-hour ceasefire, President Zelenskyy reported nearly 3,000 violations by
      Russian forces during the period, not just limited to drone and artillery
      strikes, but including full-scale troop assaults across multiple fronts.
      It immediately became clear that the "truce" was nothing more than a PR
      stunt, aimed at creating the illusion of restraint while continuing the
      war unabated. In good faith, Zelenskyy even suggested extending the
      ceasefire into a full 30-day halt in fighting, but Russia never formally
      responded. Conveniently, the stunt also gave Putin a boost in optics with
      President Trump, who, still fuming over recent spats with Zelenskyy,
      seemed all too willing to play along with the narrative that Russia was at
      least “trying” for peace.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Monday, April 21st, as expected,
      <a
        href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/4/21/russia-resumes-strikes-on-ukraine-as-easter-ceasefire-ends"
        >Russia</a
      >
      wasted no time returning to full-scale attacks after its farcical 30-hour
      "Easter truce" expired. Ukrainian officials reported an overnight barrage
      of 96 drones and multiple missile strikes targeting the Kharkiv,
      Dnipropetrovsk, and Cherkasy regions, with Russia unleashing another wave
      of devastation just hours after pretending to seek peace. President
      Zelenskyy reiterated Ukraine’s willingness to extend a real ceasefire,
      proposing a 30-day halt to long-range strikes on civilian
      infrastructure—but unsurprisingly, Putin declined, justifying continued
      bombings by again claiming military targets were nearby. (Need we revisit
      the last two weeks, where this same excuse followed every civilian
      massacre?) Meanwhile, the Kremlin’s real objective became even clearer:
      manufacture blame against Ukraine to feed the
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/21/europe/putin-easter-truce-ukraine-analysis-intl/index.html"
        >false narrative</a
      >
      Trump could use to excuse Russia’s bad faith. Even as Kyiv and its allies
      prepared for fresh peace talks in London, Trump continued insisting that a
      deal would happen "this week," blissfully ignoring the reality that Russia
      has no intention of ending its war.

      On Tuesday, the Trump administration’s “final offer” for Ukraine was
      finally revealed—and it was about what you would expect from this stellar
      crew.
      <a
        href="https://www.axios.com/2025/04/22/trump-russia-ukraine-peace-plan-crimea-donbas"
        >According to Axios</a
      >, the framework demands a series of concessions that President Zelenskyy
      has already made clear are entirely off the table, including recognizing
      the loss of all Ukrainian land currently under Russian occupation. The
      “deal” also seeks to control Ukraine’s future, barring any future NATO
      membership, while somehow still failing to offer any real military
      guarantees in return. And what exactly does Russia have to concede under
      this so-called agreement? No one really knows—other than that they would
      apparently agree to stop their unjust invasion (how generous). While the
      final offer dominated headlines, a
      <a
        href="https://www.yahoo.com/news/huge-explosion-rocked-russian-ammo-191354948.html"
        >massive explosion</a
      >
      was also reported at an ammunition depot northeast of Moscow, more than
      300 miles from the Ukrainian border. Russia, as usual, claimed the blast
      was the result of a fire and general incompetence—an explanation they
      often roll out to downplay Ukraine’s highly effective strikes.
      Surprisingly, Ukraine didn’t claim responsibility this time, so maybe,
      just maybe, this one was actually pure Russian ineptitude.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Wednesday, the day following the release of the “final offer,” it
      pretty much immediately crashed and burned as Zelenskyy stood his ground,
      specifically rejecting any proposal that would involve Russia’s illegal
      occupation of Crimea. In response to Zelenskyy’s stance—something that has
      been public knowledge as a red line for quite some time—<a
        href="https://www.npr.org/2025/04/23/nx-s1-5373407/ukraine-peace-talks-us-trump-russia-putin"
        >Trump</a
      >
      threw a tantrum on Truth Social, claiming Zelenskyy had made “inflammatory
      statements” by refusing to recognize Crimea as Russian land. Of course,
      Trump conveniently left out the fact that it was Putin who outright
      ignored Zelenskyy’s request for a 30-day ceasefire, which could have
      served as a legitimate base for negotiations. It's also important to note
      that while Ukraine obviously wasn’t thrilled with this “offer,” neither
      were the Russians—if you have the time, I highly recommend checking out
      Preston Stewart’s video,
      <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xkKGLDBHl64"
        ><em>Trump’s Final Offer: Both Sides Hate It</em></a
      ><em>.</em> As a veteran, I always appreciate seeing levelheaded military
      folk tackle these topics, and his work—and support for Ukraine—is
      absolutely worth a look. As if to underscore where his real loyalty lies,
      Trump’s administration also skipped sending top officials to the London
      peace talks, downgrading America's presence while his special envoys
      instead prepared for their fourth meeting with Putin himself later this
      week. Meanwhile, the war raged on:
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/23/europe/rubio-russia-ukraine-ceasefire-talks-intl-hnk/index.html"
        >Russia</a
      >
      struck Kharkiv and Kyiv with another drone and missile barrage, killing at
      least nine civilians. But again, according to Trump, the real problem is
      that Ukraine won’t surrender fast enough.
    </p>
    <p>
      Thursday, Russia unleashed its
      <a
        href="https://abcnews.go.com/International/russia-launches-massive-deadly-strike-kyiv-ukrainian-authorities/story?id=121113739"
        >deadliest barrage</a
      >
      on Kyiv in months, killing at least 12 people and injuring over 100 others
      across the capital. Despite the horror of yet another mass civilian
      attack—one that included North Korean ballistic missiles—Trump responded
      by posting on Truth Social a strongly worded message, with “Vladimir,
      STOP!” being the highlight of the post. Trump also finally clarified what
      “big concessions” Russia would be making under his so-called final offer:
      stopping the war, or in other words, not taking all of Ukraine, just the
      parts they currently occupy. President Zelenskyy, speaking from South
      Africa, condemned the attacks as some of the most brazen of the war and
      pointed out the obvious: no real U.S. pressure is being applied on Russia.
      Trump, meanwhile, seems more interested in pretending progress is around
      the corner rather than confronting who’s actually prolonging the killing,
      so nothing new there.
    </p>
    <p>
      On Friday,
      <a
        href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/04/25/europe/russian-military-officer-killed-intl/index.html"
        >Trump</a
      >
      again insisted that Russia and Ukraine were “very close to a deal” after
      his special envoy Steve Witkoff met face-to-face with Putin in Moscow for
      the fourth time. Russian officials eagerly praised the talks as
      “constructive and very useful,” but the reality remains the same: nothing
      fundamental has changed. Trump is still banking on a deeply lopsided
      framework that rewards Russian aggression and demands Ukrainian
      unconditional surrender—all while pretending Putin’s mere willingness to
      talk is some great act of compromise. Meanwhile, Trump’s self-imposed
      100-day deadline, after the 24-hour deadline failed, to end the war is
      rapidly approaching, which no doubt explains the delusional statements
      coming out every other day. In stark contrast to the handshakes in Moscow,
      a high-ranking Russian general, Yaroslav Moskalik, was assassinated in a
      car bombing just outside Moscow. While Ukraine hasn’t formally claimed
      responsibility, the operation fits a familiar pattern of Kyiv’s past
      targeted strikes.

    <p>
      On Saturday,
      <a
        href="https://www.reuters.com/world/ukraines-zelenskiy-met-trump-rome-zelenskiys-office-says-2025-04-26/"
        >Trump and Zelenskyy</a
      >
      met inside St. Peter’s Basilica before the funeral of Pope Francis,
      marking their first one-on-one encounter since their infamous shouting
      match in the Oval Office. The 15-minute conversation, held with no aides
      present, was described by both sides as “productive,” though the actual
      outcomes remain vague.
      <a
        href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/04/26/trump-putin-zelenskyy-meeting-00311685"
        >Trump</a
      >
      later posted a rare challenge to Putin on Truth Social, suggesting that
      the latest wave of deadly Russian missile strikes, like the one that
      killed 12 civilians in Kyiv earlier this week, might mean Putin "doesn’t
      want to stop the war" after all. Meanwhile, on the battlefield,
      <a
        href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/26/world/europe/russia-kursk-ukraine.html"
        >Russia</a
      >
      claimed it had fully expelled Ukrainian forces from Kursk Oblast,
      something they have now claimed several times, but Ukraine immediately
      denied it, saying operations are ongoing. In another major development,
      Russia also officially confirmed that North Korean troops had been
      assisting its forces in repelling the Ukrainian incursion—the first formal
      admission after months of evidence from independent analysts. Even as
      Trump tries to sell the idea that peace is imminent, Ukraine faces an
      uneasy partnership with the United States, while Russia openly
      consolidates its alliances and escalates its war effort.
