      There is only one major race yet to be certified nearly 6 months after the
      ‘24 general election<sup><a href="#fn1" id="ref1">1</a></sup
      >: The North Carolina Supreme Court. After Democrat incumbent Allison
      Riggs won the election and two recounts, Republican challenger Jefferson
      Griffin is still seeking to challenge 60,000 votes - even after an appeals
      Judge noted that he “has yet to identify a single voter—among the tens of
      thousands Petitioner challenges in this appeal—who was, in fact,
      ineligible to vote”.<sup><a href="#fn2" id="ref2">2</a></sup>
    </p>
    <p>
      This race has become a flashpoint of MAGAs election interference tactics -
      and also the frontline for the resistance against them. Over the past
      week, DGG, PV, and VGG have sought the contact information for
      <strong>all</strong> 5,509 of the voters who are currently at risk of
      disenfranchisement, and will be reaching out to them soon to cure their
      ballots - and we will need your help.
    </p>
    <h4><a id="_danw1c77w5k"></a>The Timeline</h4>
    <p>
      Post-election judicial actions seek “to balance the public’s interest in
      achieving accurate election results with the need to finalize those
      results in a short period of time.” <em>(Bouvier v. Porter)</em>.
      Finalizing the results quickly was a key reason the Supreme Court ended Al
      Gore's recounts in just over a month, so it is some surprise that the
      current election is still contested nearly 6 months after election day.

        >full timeline</a
      ><sup><a href="#fn3" id="ref3">3</a></sup> is defined by endless appeals
      and courtroom hot potato - the entire month of January was spent
      deliberating who actually had jurisdiction over the case. The key details
      are as follows:

                Griffin requests that 60k votes targeting democrat leaning areas
                should not be counted - about 1% of the total votes cast in the
                election. He focuses on three key categories: Overseas voters

    <p>
      You may have noticed that this story is entwined with ours: The story of
      the rise of online political organizing and communities. This is not one
      of many voter cure operations - this is the main one. There are no
      reinforcements, and nobody to pickup the slack if we falter. Our aligned
      communities are going to determine the fate of the voter cure efforts.
    </p>
    <p>If you have ever considered getting involved, the time is now:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Voter cure is extremely effective</strong></li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      This race has 0.01% margins. Every single voter we reach out to takes the
      time to vote from overseas - these are people who want their votes to
      count. <br />
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <strong>We have personal skin in the game<br /></strong>The North
        Carolina ‘24 canvassing team knocked on tens of thousands of doors in NC
        and can claim to have directly, personally, flipped this race. <br />
      </li>
      <li>
        <strong>We cannot let VGG take our crown</strong><br />DGG has always
        been the most politically active IRL, but Vaush has been cultivating his
        online political action programs for years. For the first stage of this
        project, VGG/PV contributed an order of magnitude more than DGG in this

    <p>
      To reiterate: This coming has a chance to be the most effective action we
      can take outside of the election cycle - not just letting us help put a
      Democratic judge into power, but also to stand against MAGA election
      attacks, and potentially to prove our value to the party.
