    <p>
      On the 27th of March, French President Macron announced a “Coalition of
      the Willing”, a European “<a
        href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/27/coalition-of-the-willing-meets-in-paris-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine"
        >reassurance</a
      >” force to bolster Ukraine’s defense in the event of a peace deal. The
      coalition, made up of over 30 countries, plans to be installed similarly
      to the 1990s NATO peacekeeping model in the Balkans. Small pockets of
      soldiers spread out around Ukraine’s flank and port cities to keep
      European troops away from the likely ceasefire line and instead meant to
      bolster key Ukrainian infrastructure.
    </p>
    <p>
      The coalition, however, has been called the
      <a href="https://x.com/AnnaKalczynska/status/1909549972787175840"
        >Coalition of the Waiting</a
      >
      by some critics. The EU is terrified of an escalation with Russia, and a
      common thread with its leaders is a tough but cautious stand towards the
      imperialist state. The Coalition also relies on the US security umbrella,
      something the US has recently signaled it isn’t too pleased with. With
      Washington slowly but surely decreasing its European footprint, Europe
      must build a strong fighting force not spread out in pockets throughout
      Europe, but mobile, and ready to deploy wherever Russia may threaten
      Europe next.

      If the EU wants to truly build a reassurance force, it will need more than
      just symbolic troops, far from the front line, that rely on the deus ex
      machina of the US to provide legitimacy. Skeptics often claim Europe lacks
      airlift to rapidly redeploy troops around Europe, and cite a lack of
      manpower in its members' armies.<a

      soldiers, allowing more flexibility in its military movements.
    </p>
    <p>
      General Mikhail Kostarakos, the chair of the European Union Military
      Committee, noted the lack of strategic enablers in Europe. He is referring
      to things such as air to air refueling, intelligence gathering,
      satellites, and air and missile defense systems. He echoes concerns many
      have; that Europe is not capable of defending itself on its own, and needs
      US backing for legitimacy. However, the EU has spent billions more on
      defense, with
      <a
        href="https://pragmaticpapers.github.io/08/zeitenwende-and-germanys-role-in-european-defense/"
        >Germany leading the charge</a
      >. Europe has the tools it needs to defend itself from Russia, and they
      may be in use in the near future.

      Barry R. Posen <a href="https://archive.ph/sO9QP">suggests </a>Europe
      should fulfill the
      <a
        href="https://www.nato.int/nato_static_fl2014/assets/pdf/pdf_2018_06/20180608_1806-NATO-Readiness-Initiative_en.pdf"
        >NATO Readiness Initiative</a
      >, a proposal from around 2018 which called for the deployment of 30
      battalions, 30 squadrons, and 30 ships ready to deploy to Eastern Europe
      in 30 days. Though the Four 30s never came to be, Europe has more of a
      reason than ever to ensure its success this time around. Europe
      collectively has around 100 fighter squadrons, 100 warships, and 100
      brigades. It would need only 10 to be able to fulfill the NRI.
      <a href="https://www.eurofighter.com/"
        >Europe’s air forces are state of the art,</a
      >
      and could easily provide the necessary air support to back up its ground
      forces.
    </p>
    <p>
      Ten brigades will not be close to enough to fully counter Russia’s 90 odd
      regiments. Russian troops are battle-hardened and experienced in modern
      combat, something that cannot be said for Europe’s forces in kind. Split
      the EU brigades into two good mechanized corps, however, and suddenly it
      becomes a significant force that cannot be overlooked. To compare, it
      would be 2/3rds the size of the force that conquered all of Iraq in 2003.
      Consolidation of power within EU armies is key for the success of the
      Coalition. Indeed, this exact method was suggested by NATO towards Ukraine
      for their Zaporizhzhia offense in 2023, something that Ukrainians ignored.
      It led to, at best, a pyrrhic victory for Ukraine, a blow which could’ve
      been dampened significantly.
    </p>
    <p>
      Europe’s forces are not fully combat-capable yet, however. Equipment is
      degrading and needs replacement/maintenance. Ammunition and parts for
      vehicles are not exactly in great supply right now. The EU will also need
      short range anti aircraft, ready to counter the drones that permeate the
      war. With<a

      >
        Germany’s defense sector roaring to life</a
      >, and commitments from UK and France however, the three pillars of the EU
      stand ready to donate supplies, and money, towards the readiness and
      capability of a united Coalition.

    <h4>The Essence of War</h4>

    <blockquote>
      “Speed is the essence of War. Exploit the enemy’s unpreparedness; attack
      him unawares; take an unexpected route.” ― Sun Tzu,
      <a href="https://www.goodreads.com/work/quotes/3200649"
        ><em>The Art of War</em></a
      >
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      Where will Russia look next? The Eye of Putin could shine its unholy gaze
      upon the Baltics, or begin to glance at Poland. Who is to say they even
      take their sight off Ukraine, the breadbasket of Europe? Waiting for the
      answers to these questions is not an option, Europe must field a
      battle-ready, speedy set of battalions to be able to answer Russia,
      wherever in Europe they may strike.
    </p>
    <div class="image-container">
      <img src="/uploads/09/youkraine.webp" alt="Image 2" />
      <span class="caption">Ukraine? No, Youkraine.</span>
    </div>
    <p>
      To do this, the EU must begin setting up the infrastructure in eastern
      Europe. Bridges in places like Poland are already being reinforced. The EU
      has spent over
      <a
        href="https://www.consilium.europa.eu/en/policies/investment-plan/strategic-investments-fund/"
        >38 billion</a
      >
      to upgrade transportation infrastructure. Ports will need to be reinforced
      as well, and Europe should organize its trucking industry to support
      military shipping. It will need to install more fiber optic cables,
      integrate rails from Eastern and Western Europe, and build more fuel
      tanks. This will ensure the EU has the capability to actually transport
      the troops, and rapidly.
    </p>
    <p>
      For the speediness of the Coalition to work, Europe must also consolidate
      its forces. Without confirmed US assistance, it needs to build its own
      intelligence and reconnaissance infrastructure. A soldier cannot be
      deployed if he doesn’t know what he is deploying into. The EU can use the
      Eurocorps as a foundation of future corps and planning, and use NATO
      guidelines to enhance the effectiveness of their forces. Europe must stop
      its long history of military burden sharing, and allow France, Germany,
      and the UK to take the lead, leveraging the strengths of each nation to
      ensure a stable, just peace. Europe has the power to take its security in
      its own hands, and not rely on a fickle American president to decide its
      fate for them. Now all it needs is the will to actualize it.
    </p>
    <h4>The Shadow over Europe</h4>

    <blockquote>
      “Peacekeeping with American help is old think.” ― <em><a href="https://archive.ph/sO9QP">Barry R. Posen</a> </em>
    </blockquote>

    <p>
      For over 60 years, Europe has looked to the US to secure its future.
      Reliance on NATO made Europe reduce its defense spending, seeing bloody
      conflict as a thing of the past. The Shadow over Europe was wide, and
      Europeans felt comfort being in its cool embrace. Now that the Trump
      administration has decided it resents being the world’s defender, it looks
      to remove the shade. Europeans must face the sunlight on their own. They’d
      better buy some sunglasses.
    </p>

      When Macron
      <a
        href="https://www.euronews.com/my-europe/2025/03/27/coalition-of-the-willing-meets-in-paris-to-strengthen-support-for-ukraine"
        >introduced the Coalition</a
      >, it sent shockwaves throughout Europe. Not every member was on board
      with the reassurance force. Polish Prime Minister Donald Tusk confirmed
      they would not be sending troops to Ukraine, and Giorgia Meloni of Italy
      declined to participate at all. But countries reluctant to put troops on
      the ground can instead deploy them to neighboring states. They can also
      provide intel, ships, aircraft, armor, among other support. With the
      Franco-British Joint Team headed to Ukraine, the gears are moving, and it
      is important to allocate the resources of each Coalition member
      appropriately. The Joint Team already faces delays due to missing US
      commitments. Stalling for time and shuffling of feet is the worst possible
      stance to take.

        >Even Neville Chamberlain prepared for war</a
      >, despite his hopes of a peaceful solution Hitler’s early aggressions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Diplomats, however, worry about Europe’s readiness without the United
      States.
      <a

        >France is adamant </a
      >that America is not needed for the Coalition, other members privately
      worried.
      <a href="https://archive.ph/sf1Fx"
        >Though Washington has opened the door for logistical and intelligence
        sharing,</a
      >
      showing that despite an erratic POTUS, American support may be possible.
    </p>
    <p>
      Though the US hasn’t pulled out completely, European nations must secure
      its own future, and indeed, seem to be doing so already. Turkey is ready
      to assume responsibility in Odessa, one of the flanks covered by the
      reassurance force. It will keep grain routes open, clear Black Sea mines,
      and take charge of the international maritime force in the region. France
      and the UK have sent their joint team, and Poland is helping improve its
      infrastructure to ensure a speedy Coalition force. The Baltic Trio of
      Estonia, Latvia, and Lithuania are completely on board with the Coalition.
      Denmark, Belgium, and the Netherlands are also leaning the right way.
      Germany is busy building a government, but with Merz signaling his support
      for Ukraine and the Zeitenwende, it is very likely Berlin will join. The
      biggest economy and defense sector in Europe is nothing to sneeze at, and
      will likely encourage other more hesitant states to chip in more.
    </p>
    <p>
      <a href="https://archive.ph/sf1Fx"
        >Even with the US privately signaling security guarantees, </a
      >Europe’s future is in its own hands. The Trump administration does not
      seem to care in what state the war ends, and an unjust peace will lead to
      more war. Washington’s proposal to freeze occupied territories along
      current battle lines, and the potential legalization of Crimea’s
      occupation shows its leanings. Europe cannot rely on a fickle Washington,
      captured by Russia propaganda, to come to its rescue. It must rise to the
      task, and counter the encroaching Russian threat, ready for action with or
      without the United States.
