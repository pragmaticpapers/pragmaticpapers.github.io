    <p>
      This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
      (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are
      not legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law,
      and are merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is
      not to say they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t
      relevant to the application of law, only that they are almost never
      controlling outside of internal executive branch administration.
    </p>
    <p>
      EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are
      published into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be
      difficult to know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason,
      these reports only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While
      this can lead to these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure
      precision and clarity.

    <h3>EO 14259 – Amendment to Reciprocal Tariffs and Updated Duties as
      Applied to Low-Value Imports From the People's Republic of China</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a

    </div>

    <p>
      This EO relies on the

        >3 USC 301</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 is just a bunch of bullshit about China’s reciprocal tariffs
      being a national security threat.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 raises the tariff from 34% to 84%.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 adjusts duties and tariffs on de minimis shipments in various
      ways.
    </p>
    <p>Section 4 orders various executive officers to implement the EO.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is one of the many tariffs that the Administration has used in an
      attempt to bring China to the negotiating table.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      As of the writing of this article, all signs point to the Administration
      backing down and removing the tariffs. As America continues to waiver and
      fold, so too will international confidence in America’s abilities
      economically and in other domains.

    <h3>EO 14260 – Protecting American Energy From State Overreach</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-14/pdf/2025-06379.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>

    <p>
      Section 1 complains about state laws that attempt to regulate the energy
      industry due to concerns about climate change.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 directs the AG to identify unconstitutional state and local
      regulations that are burdensome energy resources and attempt to have them
      overtuned.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is an incredibly inappropriate action for the Administration to take.
      It is an explicit attempt for the federal government to step in and
      overturn state and local laws. This is a violation of the foundational
      principles of federalism and the dual sovereignty that this nation was
      founded on. There is very little in the constitution regarding
      environmental regulations, especially ones enacted by the states.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      It is incredibly likely that we will see some baseless lawsuits against
      the various state environmental agencies and the states themselves for the
      entirely constitutional laws regarding climate regulations. Not only will
      this be an attack on necessary climate regulations to help prevent climate
      change, but it also will be the first step in stripping states of their
      sovereignty and independence from federal overreach.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14261 – Reinvigorating America's Beautiful Clean Coal Industry and
      Amending Executive Order 14241</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-14/pdf/2025-06380.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>Section 1 glazes coal with a bunch of lies.</p>
    <p>Section 2 states that the policy of the US that coal is essential.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders that coal be designated a mineral so that it is afforded
      benefits under EO 14241.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders executive officers assess federal laws and policies that
      might hinder the coal mining industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders executive officers to assess federal lands to be opened
      up to coal mining.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 orders executive officers and agencies to assess policies and
      laws that would hinder coal energy generation. It encourages loans and
      other funding sources to help facilitate coal energy generation.
    </p>
    <p>Section 7 orders executive officers to promote coal exports.</p>
    <p>
      Section 8 orders agencies to identify exclusions that would hinder the
      production and export of coal.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9 orders the Secretary of Energy to see if the use of coal in
      steel production can be afforded protection under the Energy Act of 2020
      and label it a critical material.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10 orders executive officers to find ways to use coal to power AI
      data centers.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11 orders the Secretary of Energy to take all necessary actions to
      accelerate coal technologies.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      The Administration is taking all possible measures to assist the coal
      industry.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      We should expect the rapid expansion of the coal industry in the short
      term with the destruction of many previously protected federal lands. In
      the long term it will be surprising to see if this has any real effect on
      the world transitioning away from coal.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14262 – Strengthening the Reliability and Security of the United
      States Electric Grid</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-14/pdf/2025-06381.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 discusses a lack of reliability when it comes to American energy
      demand.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 establishes the policy of the US to reinforce its electric power
      grid.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of Energy to take steps to improve the
      reliability of the electric grid.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO likely will lead to further use of coal and less use of green
      energy sources. Solar, wind, and other green energy is often considered
      less reliable, while coal, a Trump darling, is considered reliable.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      This EO will likely, in conjunction with EO 14261 will be used to promote
      and support the American coal industry at the expense of green energy.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14263 – Addressing Risks From Susman Godfrey</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06458.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>
    
    <p>This is yet another EO attacking a law firm.</p>

    <h3>EO 14264 – Maintaining Acceptable Water Pressure in Showerheads</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06459.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 bemoans overregulation and points out that Obama-Biden passed a
      thirteen thousand word definition of the word “<a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2020/12/16/2020-27280/energy-conservation-program-definition-of-showerhead"
        >Showerhead</a
      >”.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 repeals this long definition.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is pretty straightforward EO, it repeals some regulatory language
      around showerheads.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      While this is in line with the Administration’s goal to reduce
      regulations, it is far more likely simply a publicity stunt. The audacity
      to define a showerhead with 13,000 words on its face is likely scoffed at
      and mocked by conservatives, so this is low hanging fruit for the hogs who
      support him.

    <h3>EO 14265 – Modernizing Defense Acquisitions and Spurring Innovation in
      the Defense Industrial Base</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06461.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 says that the acquisition of military hardware is important, but
      that the defense acquisition system of America is not up to scratch.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 says it is the policy of the US government to accelerate defense
      procurement and revitalize the defense industrial base.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of Defense to create a plan to reform the
      DoD’s acquisition process.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders the Secretary to eliminate any unnecessary supplemental
      regulations or other guidance and promote the streamlining of acquisitions
      by removing regulations where necessary.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders various Secretaries within the DoD to develop a plan to
      reform and train the workforce for defense acquisitions.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 orders various Secretaries within the DoD to perform a
      comprehensive review of all major defense acquisition programs for
      efficiency and redundant regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7 orders various Secretaries within the DoD to review the Joint
      Capabilities Integration and Development System with the goal of
      streamlining and accelerating acquisition.
    </p>
    <p>Section 8 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      The deregulation and micromanagement of government spending trend has come
      to the DoD. Now spending will be hampered less by regulations and fraud
      prevention, and instead be easier to manipulate by the Administration for
      purposes of corruption.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      Defense spending is the largest discretionary spending line item in the US
      budget. This means it is the largest target for corruption and graft. This
      will likely remove a lot of the regulations that prevent the
      monopolization of defense contracts, and remove much of the accountability
      and fraud prevention for defense spending. We will likely see a less
      lethal military, at a higher price.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14266 – Modifying Reciprocal Tariff Rates To Reflect Trading Partner
      Retaliation and Alignment</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06462.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <p>
      This EO relies on the
      <a
        href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82"
        >International Economic Emergency Powers Act</a
      >
      (the “IEEPA”), the
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&amp;edition=prelim"
        >National Emergencies Act</a
      >
      (the “NEA”), the
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10384/pdf/COMPS-10384.pdf"
        >Trade Act of 1974 § 604</a
      >, and
      <a
        href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:3%20section:301%20edition:prelim)"
        >3 USC 301</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 declares a national emergency arising from trade deficits such
      that further adjustments to the tariffs previously established are
      necessary.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 drops almost all tariffs identified in EO 14257 to 10%.</p>
    <p>Section 3 changes the tariffs on china from 84% to 125%.</p>
    <p>
      Section 4 extends the date of applying De Minimis tariffs an additional 90
      days and increases the tariff rate.
    </p>
    <p>Section 5 orders various executive officers to implement this EO.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      Trump got spooked by nations coordinating to dump US bonds threatening
      interest rates, so he backed off on most of the tariffs. China negotiating
      hard caused him to continue the brinkmanship he started.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      As of the writing of this article, all signs point to the Administration
      backing down and removing the tariffs. As America continues to waiver and
      fold, so too will international confidence in America’s abilities
      economically and in other domains.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14267 – Reducing Anti-Competitive Regulatory Barriers</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06463.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 complains that regulations are used to pick economic winners and
      losers.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders agency heads to consult with the Chairman of the FTC and
      AG to review regulations that could implicate antitrust issues with
      regards to competition in the market.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO takes an antitrust approach to deregulation. It is largely
      requesting a book report about potential anti-competitive regulations.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      This fits within the numerous deregulation EOs and memos from the
      Administration. It is unlikely that any regulations eliminated due to this
      EO will result in an increase in competitiveness within the US economy.
      Antitrust is a very heavily litigated field, laws and regulations within
      the field are well tested and it is unlikely that there is much meat on
      the bone for a good faith interpretation of this EO.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14268 – Reforming Foreign Defense Sales To Improve Speed and
      Accountability</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-15/pdf/2025-06464.pdf"
        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 talks about how integrating our partners who purchase US
      military equipment is important.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 sets the policy of the admin to deregulate and streamline the
      sale of military equipment.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3 orders various executive officers to implement the EO.</p>
    <p>Section 4 sets Definitions for the EO.</p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO appears to be the Administration pushing for more military sales.
      It also appears to remove regulations around who the weapons are sold to.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      The EO is a strange one as it appears to be promoting an idea that
      international partners and integration is important, despite this being
      antithetical to the Administration’s platform. It likely will result in
      some uptick in military sales, it likely will be due to America selling to
      parties who would have been deemed too dangerous to sell to.
    </p>

    <h3>EO 14269 – Restoring America's Maritime Dominance</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">

        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 talks about the deficiencies of the US shipbuilding industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states it is the policy of the US to revitalize the shipbuilding
      industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders various executive officers to set up a plan to implement
      this EO.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders various executive officers to provide an assessment of
      the available authorities and resources for shipbuilding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 is a bunch of paranoia about China and opens the door for
      further tariffs in order to protect the ship building industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 orders that ships bearing foreign trade submit to the tariffs he
      had implemented.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7 orders various executive officers to engage with other countries
      regarding this EO.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8 orders that measures be taken to try to bring foreign investment
      to the US for shipbuilding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9 orders various executive officers to establish a trust fund to
      help provide funding for shipbuilding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10 orders various executive officers to establish financial
      incentive structures in relation to ship building.

    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12 orders various executive officers to identify needs of the

    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13 orders various executive officers to to identify ways to
      increase training of mariners and other support staff for shipbuilding and
      operation
    </p>
    <p>Section 14 orders the US Merchant Marine Academy be modernized.</p>
    <p>
      Section 15 orders various executive officers to develop a proposal for
      improved acquisition strategies that would support shipbuilding.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 16 orders DOGE to review DOD and DHS procurement processes in
      order to make them more efficient and effective.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 17 orders various executive officers to increase the US trading
      fleet size.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 18 orders various executive officers to develop a strategy to
      secure arctic waterways for America.

      Section 19 orders various executive officers to submit a report to the
      president regarding the participants and competitors within the
      shipbuilding industry.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 20 orders various executive officers to conduct a review of
      regulations and their implementation concerning shipping and port access
      for increased efficiencies by stripping unnecessary rules and regulations.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 21 orders the Secretary of Defense to review and issue guidance
      relating to an inactive reserve fleet.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This is a very comprehensive EO targeted at increasing domestic, and even
      allied, shipbuilding and American international shipping. While the
      methods still seem to lean heavily on the private sector and focus on
      deregulation, the effort seems at least partially genuine. This has been a
      minor part of the Administration’s platform, and this seems in line with
      previous statements.

    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      While this is a serious effort, without congressional backing it is likely
      little more than words on paper. Additionally, it’s not even clear if
      domestic shipbuilding is the correct path forward for the US military.
      Naval vessels are relevant, but domestic production is not a clear
      necessity. America has outsourced shipbuilding throughout our history, and
      such jobs do not easily fit within the current configuration of the US
      economy. That is not to say this EO, and the Administration’s goals are
      unattainable, only that domestic production will be more costly, and
      likely have less of an impact militarily than using such resources more
      efficiently with allied production in mind.

    <h3>EO 14270 – Zero-Based Regulatory Budgeting To Unleash American
      Energy</h3>

    <div class="supplementary">
      (<a

        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 complains about how long regulatory and law codes are in America
      and how sunset provisions are needed.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>Section 3 Establishes which agencies and acts this applies to.</p>
    <p>
      Section 4 states that all covered agencies shall implement a sunset rule
      by 9/30/25 for regulations so that all regulations must be reaffirmed
      within 1 to 5 years.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 states that if a regulation is sunsetted it doesn’t count
      towards the 10 for 1 regulatory requirement from
      <a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/02/06/2025-02345/unleashing-prosperity-through-deregulation"
        >EO 14192</a
      >.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This will only impact regulations promulgated by agencies, it will not
      affect laws passed by congress. This will mean that all regulatory rules
      and regulations will now need to be reaffirmed every 1 to 5 years. In
      theory, this means that old laws that are no longer relevant will
      naturally be removed from the US code. It is important to note, that any
      of these rules and regulations can be removed by various processes within
      the US government already should they become burdensome or unnecessary.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      This, like many conservative ideas, is one that sounds good with a passing
      thought, but falls apart upon any real scrutiny. What this EO really does
      is make every single rule and regulation a negotiation and fight.
      Republicans consistently use such votes to extract concessions from
      Democrats and have no qualms about holding anyone and anything hostage to
      do so. It also creates unnecessary votes and bureaucracy for these
      agencies that only hinder the government’s ability to act and cost’s more
      money.

    <h3>EO 14271 – Ensuring Commercial, Cost-Effective Solutions in Federal
      Contracts</h3>

        >full text</a
      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 says that it is a major goal for the Administration to not waste
      money, making this possibly one of the funniest EO’s produced by this
      Administration so far.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 directs agencies to buy products and services that are
      commercially available pursuant to the
      <a href="https://www.congress.gov/bill/103rd-congress/senate-bill/1587"
        >Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994</a
      >.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders all agencies to conduct a review of potential contracts
      or expenditures to make sure there is not a commercially available
      alternative.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 creates a requirement that any non-commercial development of a
      product or service must be approved by the Director of OMB.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO is an attempt to commercialize many aspects of the US government.
      In the name of efficiency and cost savings, it attempts to do away with
      any in house products or services of the government.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      It’s not currently clear how much of an impact this will have, the US
      government already contracts for the vast majority of products and
      services it requires. It does expand the Federal Acquisition Streamlining
      Act for procurement, which removes some requirements that could increase
      costs or procurement time, though could lead to more opportunities for
      graft and corruption. It ultimately will make the US government more
      dependent on the markets, and less likely to be able to craft specific
      solutions to specific problems. It also will lead to the US government
      employing less specialized workers, and instead hiring experts as they are
      needed.

    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 talks about how important critical minerals, including rare
      earth elements, are important for economic and national security.
    </p>
    <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of Commerce to investigate under
      <a href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/19/1862">Section 232</a>
      to determine if economic policy to address potential national security
      issues regarding to domestic critical mineral production and refinement is
      required.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This EO, in conjunction with
      <a
        href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/03/25/2025-05212/immediate-measures-to-increase-american-mineral-production"

      >, continues to focus on domestic production and refinement of minerals.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      It is likely to produce some kind of increase in or at the least threat of
      tariffs regarding minerals.

      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 talks about the need to lower drug prices. It blames Biden for
      price increases over the last four years. It continues the lie that there
      is a pill penalty in the IRA, when in reality it is a price control to
      reduce costs on prescription medication.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states it is the policy of the US to lower prescription drug
      costs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 3 orders the Secretary of HHS to create guidance or more
      transparency and attempt to reduce the effects of the IRA on drug prices
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders the Secretary to come up with a plan to reduce the cost
      of high-cost prescription drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 orders the Secretary to publish a plan to conduct a survey of
      the SSA to determine how much hospitals are paying for outpatient drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 orders various executive officers to provide recommendations to
      the President on “how best to ensure that manufactures pay accurate
      Medicaid drug rebates”, promote innovation for drug payment methodologies,
      link payments for drugs to the value obtained, and support states in
      managing drug spending.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 7 orders the Secretary to make grants for medical research be
      conditioned upon health care centers establish practices to make insulin
      and injectable epinephrine available at or below discounted prices.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 8 requires a report to the President on how to make medical supply
      chains more efficient.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 9 requires a report for recommendations on how to accelerate
      approvals for the use of new medications, and reclassifying prescription
      medications as over the counter medications.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 10 wants to open barriers that could prevent importation of
      prescription drugs.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 11 requires evaluation of spending by Medicare to make sure that
      it isn’t being sent to outpatient clinics that are more expensive than in
      hospital clinics.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 12 requires the Secretary of Labor to promulgate new regulations
      under ERISA.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 13 orders the Secretary of HHS to conduct public listening
      sessions with personnel from the DOJ and other departments to reduce
      anti-competitive behavior from big pharma.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      That Trump has been bought off by big pharma. Almost every single thing in
      this EO in some way benefits drug manufacturers.

    </div>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      Expect drug prices to increase, and outpatient clinics to receive less
      patients. The Administration will likely be focusing on overloading
      hospitals to disincentivize elderly and those who would file claims under
      Medicare and Medicaid.

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 orders that federal buildings be prioritized in central business
      districts in urban areas.

    <p>
      Section 2 revokes

      and orders that the Administrator of General Services amend relevant
      regulations.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This radically reduces prior requirements for Federal building placement.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      Federal Buildings now will not need to take into account development of
      the area, environmental impact, or prioritize the use of historic
      buildings.

      >)
    </div>

    <h4>Overview</h4>
    <p>
      Section 1 complains about how hard it is to do business with the Federal
      Government.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 2 states that it is the policy of the Administration to make
      procurement efficient.
    </p>
    <p>Section 3 defines terms for the EO.</p>
    <p>
      Section 4 orders officers under the Federal Acquisition Regulatory Council
      and agency heads to amend the Federal Acquisition Regulation (“FAR”) to
      ensure it contains only provisions that are required by statute or support
      efficiency.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 5 all agencies that exercising procurement authority pursuant to
      FAR shall designate a senior acquisition official to work with the
      Administrator of FAR and FAR council to ensure alignment with this EO and
      resultant reforms.
    </p>
    <p>
      Section 6 creates a sunset provision for all regulations under FAR for 4
      years.
    </p>
    <h4>What It Means</h4>
    <p>
      This, in conjunction with
      <a
        href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-03-25/pdf/2025-05197.pdf"
        >EO 14240</a
      >
      and a number of other EOs, continues to create more officers and
      bureaucracy when it comes to government spending.
    </p>
    <h4>Looking Foward</h4>
    <p>
      This will likely do very little to make the process of procurement more
      efficient, and instead open more room for graft and corruption by
      government contractors.
