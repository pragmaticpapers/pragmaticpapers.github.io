      As the era of Elon running DOGE wanes, there are little baby DOGEs popping
      up faster than Elon can have IVF more kids. Funny, sure– until you realize
      that these efforts are more likely to cost taxpayers millions while
      pretending to “save” them money. To be clear, everyone thinks the concept
      of DOGE is a pretty good one. The government is big, and just like any big
      house, it constantly needs cleaning and tweaking. But how that gets done
      matters, and no one likes living in a house mid-reno. Elon’s stank may
      have revved up folks at the start, but as time marches, the effects are
      going down some interesting paths.
    </p>
    <p>Many of these DOGE-ish state entities are trying the same playbook:</p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        Restructure government power (though usually in ways that give the
        executive more power).
      </li>
      <li>
        Structure some commission or group to investigate government processes
        (groups usually run by partisan actors and often business leaders),.
      </li>
      <li>Utilize technology (usually AI) to shrink the government.</li>
      <li>Undermine or stop DEI efforts.</li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      While many aren’t going <em>full</em> Elon, they are testing the waters.

      In Florida, they attempted to pass a Joint House Resolution to repeal the
      position of Lt Governor, convenient, since they don’t have one right now,
      and make the Commissioner of Government Efficiency a Cabinet office,
      reporting directly to the Governor. What happens if the governor is
      impeached,

        >would limit the state agency’s power</a

      power from regulators and require rules to be decided by a legislative
      body, which in these states are conservative bodies.

      The Oklahoma DOGE (called DOGE-OK) credited a savings of $42,000 for
      changing to LED light bulbs– a switch made before DOGE-OK was a thing.
      Florida DOGE claimed it saved taxpayers $900 million, but it was money
      from federal funds for refugee resettlement that was rejected long before
      Florida had their DOGE.

      Instead of giving these existing agencies resources, they are sidelining
      them in hopes of claiming any savings as a DOGE initiative. The NC DOGE

      anything, if it's trained poorly, it will do bad work.This isn’t an AI
      problem, it's just a problem for any onboarding, but AI works much faster,
      with less oversight, and impacts many more people. Letting a poorly
      trained model loose will have an exponential impact, and the data before
      say, 2015, is basically trash. Significant parts are still paper based and
      if not, there likely wasn't a consistent data structure to make this a
      smooth transition. Moving to this will be expensive and time consuming up
      front. Mucking it up, even more so.

      When was the last time you had to call customer service for a decent size
      company, only to have an AI chatbot answer and struggle to understand what
      you are calling for? How did that go? So no, you don’t replace human
      judgement on complex government tasks and you can’t fire trained
      employees, slap on some ChatGPT on a janky server and magically expect it
      to know how to process birth certificates, water permits, or housing
      applications. It’s not cost cutting. It’s institutional sabotage wearing a
      tech-bro Halloween costume.

      is already a bad taste in people’s mouths that state agencies are
      noticing. Noticed that none of the state versions– DOGE, COGE, GOAT,
      GEAR–have the ability to run ramshod through the government like Elon has.
      Politicians talk tough, but when it’s time to give up power, they hold it
      tighter than a toddler with a toy. For what it’s worth, the Wisconsin GOAT
      made sure to include Democrats on their committee for some bipartisan
