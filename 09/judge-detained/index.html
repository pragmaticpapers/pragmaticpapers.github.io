      Milwaukee County Circuit Court Judge Hannah Dugan was taken into custody
      on April 25th by the FBI, alleging that she had helped Eduardo Flores-Ruiz
      evade immigration authorities a week earlier on April 18th.
      <a
        href="https://storage.courtlistener.com/recap/gov.uscourts.wied.111629/gov.uscourts.wied.111629.1.0.pdf"
        >The FBI’s complaint</a
      >
      says that Flores-Ruiz was in the courthouse for a scheduled hearing on his
      criminal case and federal agents had planned to arrest Flores-Ruiz after
      said hearing. After being notified of ICE’s presence, Judge Dugan
      confronted the arrest team and stated they needed a judicial warrant,
      rather than the administrative one they had. After directing the arrest
      team to the Chief Judge, the complaint alleges that Dugan returned to the
      courtroom, directed Flores-Ruiz and his attorney to leave through the
      non-public jury door, and adjourned his case without calling it or
      notifying the attorney handling the case on behalf of the state. Members
      of the arrest team who weren’t talking with the Chief Judge saw
      Flores-Ruiz leaving the jury room, and followed him onto the elevator and
      out of the courthouse. After a brief chase, members of the arrest team
      apprehended Flores-Ruiz outside of the courthouse. If you take the
      complaint at face value, the arrest may seem justified. But as is the case
      with a lot of the administration's actions, a little scrutiny goes a long
      way.
    </p>
    <p>
      There are a couple of details in the complaint that are notable. When
      Judge Dugan confronted federal agents in the hallway, she asked if they
      had a judicial warrant. Once they told her they had an administrative
      warrant, she said they needed a judicial warrant and to go talk to the
      Chief Judge.

    <h4>Why is this important?</h4>

        >A judicial warrant,</a
      >
      signed by a judge, authorizes law enforcement to perform an arrest or
      search on private property. An administrative warrant, which is usually
      signed by an immigration officer, does NOT.
    </p>
    <p>
      In a courthouse, there are both private spaces (like the courtroom itself,
      or the jury room) and public ones (hallways for example). But this
      distinction is not 100% defined and is still being deliberated on by
      county officials. Federal agents even confirmed with the Chief Judge that
      hallways were indeed public areas and they could perform an arrest there
      on the day they

        >attempted to arrest Flores-Ruiz</a
      >. But then why didn’t they? Agents saw Flores-Ruiz leave the jury room
      and enter the public hallway, chose to follow him down the elevator (an
      agent was in the elevator with Flores-Ruiz), let him leave the building,
      and then conducted the arrest outside. While there’s a variety of reasons
      that they could’ve waited, if the federal agents were questioning whether
      or not they could conduct the arrest in the courthouse, how does Judge
      Dugan moving Flores-Ruiz into another room obstruct them at all?
      Especially considering

      public areas, as the diagram below shows.

      It’s perfectly plausible that after being informed of Flores-Ruiz’s
      imminent arrest, Judge Dugan pulled the man and his attorney into the jury
      room, informed them of the situation, and then told them to go into the
      hallway. Considering that Flores-Ruiz was about to be deported, Judge
      Dugan adjourned his hearing and moved onto the rest of the docket.

      >, so take that as you will.
    </p>
    <p>
      It also shouldn’t be understated that this arrest and the

        >Instead of questioning Dugan beforehand or asking to turn herself in</a
      >, the FBI slapped her in cuffs at the courthouse, tweeted a picture, and
      took her into custody. Only for her to be released from custody hours
      later. But don’t take it from me, or from lawyers who agree the arrest was
      highly unusual.

        >Take it from Pam Bondi herself</a
      >, just hours after Dugan’s arrest; “I think some of these judges think
      they are beyond and above the law and they are not, and we're sending a
      very strong message today.”
