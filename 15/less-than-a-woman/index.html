  <p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
  <p>This week, World Boxing, the international governing body for Olympic
    boxing, announced new sex verification testing requirements for female
    boxers to compete in World Boxing sanctioned events. In<a
      href="https://worldboxing.org/news/#:~:text=World%20Boxing%20recognises,to%20any%20individual.">
      their announcement they stated that Imane Khelif </a>has been notified
    that she must undergo testing before competing in the next event, the
    Eindhoven Box Cup.</p>
  <p> Imane was named in the announcement as a result of controversy stemming
    from her fight in the 2024 Paris Olympics. She won against Italian boxer
    Angela Carini, who quit after receiving two blows from Imane that reportedly
    caused her intense pain. This triggered a world debate over Khelif’s sex,
    with accusations—most notably from <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/02/05/politics/olympic-womens-boxers-transitioned-trump-fact-check#:~:text=%E2%80%9CWho%20could%20forget,them%20very%20convincingly%2C%E2%80%9D">U.S.
      President Trump</a> and other influential figures—claiming she was
    transgender or male.</p>
  <p> Concerns over <a

      sex started in 2022</a> when boxing was governed by the International
    Boxing Association (IBA). Imane was tested in May that year and the results
    didn’t match the eligibility criteria. The IBA reported the information to
    the International Olympic Committee. After a lack of response from the IOC,
    the IBA decided to conduct a second test in March 2023, confirming the
    initial test results. The specific test conducted or criteria for
    eligibility have never been provided by the IBA, citing privacy. They stated
    that Imane has the results and can publish herself.</p>
  <p> Khelif was then banned from further competitions and offered the chance to
    appeal, which Khelif did. However, <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/olympics-2024-boxing-imane-khelif-iba-a26248f5285889dae13743f535ef9ed3?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=Both%20Khelif%20and,the%20financial%20burden.">her
      appeal was dropped for procedural reasons</a> after she failed to make an
    initial payment to the Court of Arbitration for Sports (CAS), a process that
    can cost more than $40,000. </p>

      IOC had already suspended the IBA’s recognition in 2019 over long standing
      financial concerns, sports integrity, and governance issues. </a>The IBA
    was accused of having close ties to Russian political and business interests
    and systemic corruption in judging and refereeing. <a

      withdrawal from the committee was completed on June 22nd, 2023</a> and the
    IOC took over governance of boxing for the 2024 Paris Olympics. This changed
    the eligibility criteria to qualify for boxing, which allowed Imane to
    compete in Paris.</p>
  <p><strong>Early Sex Testing and Its Failures</strong></p>
  <p>Concerns of men entering women’s sports has persisted since the 1940’s when
    sex verification in sports began with <a
      href="https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/09646639221086595#:~:text=However%2C%20given%20increasing%20suspicions%20that%20Eastern%20Bloc%20countries%20were%20sending%20%E2%80%98fake%E2%80%99%20women%20to%20female%20sporting%20events%2C%20the%20IOC%20and%20the%20IAAF%20established%20compulsory%20gender%20verification%20as%20a%20condition%20for%20women%20to%20take%20part%20in%20their%20competitions.">certificates
      provided by a physician</a>. These tests were initially a visual
    inspection but became a test for Barr bodies, which identified XX
    chromosomes.Those that failed the test were told in complete secrecy so they
    could withdraw without people knowing the real reason. The scientific
    community expressed concerns because there were instances where a person
    would not have two X chromosomes, or even an XY chromosome, but have
    feminized external genitals and be assigned female at birth. There were also
    concerns, specifically with those who had a Y chromosome, if these people
    had advantages over their XX competitors due to their “male” genetic make
    up.</p>
  <p>This issue was compounded because there were often no external signs of
    these issues and it would go undiagnosed in women until they had a full
    gynecological exam, which typically doesn’t occur until after puberty
    begins—often the only noticeable sign being a lack of menstruation, which is
    already not unusual for elite female athletes, even if they have XX
    chromosomes. </p>
  <p>There are no known examples of men pretending to be a woman to compete
    against women in a sporting category, which was the concern that triggered
    sex testing. Many women, or women with DSD, did face repercussions once
    their ambiguities were revealed. </p>

        1985, she didn’t and refused the advice to pretend she had an injury and
        quit. Instead she competed as scheduled and won. The press reported her
        condition and she was subsequently stripped of all medals won, expelled from

  <p>In the 1990s, the test to confirm sex was changed to the Polymerase Chain
    Reaction (PCR), which looks specifically for male genetic material. These
    tests faced harsh criticism because having such material does not
    necessarily confer a male performance advantage. The PCR test eventually <a

      to be used as a compulsory test for female athletes</a> in the mid-2000s.
    The IAAF released a new policy on gender verification that addressed
    concerns over an athlete’s gender. These efforts allowed athletes with a
    range of genetic variations that were not deemed performance-enhancing to
    compete. Even in cases where the genetic variation might confer a potential
    advantage, athletes could still be eligible if they agreed to undergo
    specified medical or surgical interventions, acknowledging that their
    genetic makeup could not be altered. </p>
  <p> Controversy broke out again when Caster Semenya won the 800m by almost 2
    seconds. Semenya<a

    levels of testosterone due to undescended testes she didn’t know until she
    received a sex test after reported concerns over her sex.</p>
  <p> Initially Semenya complied with IAAF’s regulations to lower her
    testosterone with medication. However, she eventually refused to continue
    and challenged the IAAF”s regulation in the Court of Arbitration for Sport.
    The court ruled to support the regulations requiring medical interventions
    for people with DSD to compete in female sport events. The IAAF claimed that
    female athletes with high testosterone have a<a

      1.8 to 4.5 percent advantage</a> over females with lower testosterone
    levels. </p>
  <p>Outside of boxing and track and field, other governing associations have
    not placed limitations on DSD athletes but are reporting to be monitoring
    and researching to determine if there is a need.</p>
  <p><strong>The Ideological Perspectives</strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong>Depending on your preference or media, the reporting on
    this issue can leave out important concerns from the other side. Jonathan
    Haidt’s Moral Foundations Theory<sup><sup><a href="#footnote-0"
          id="footnote-ref-0">[1]</a></sup></sup> explains how people’s
    ideological differences stem from the varying moral principles they
    prioritize, which in turn shape their policy preferences.</p>

  </table>
  <p> Both sides have understandable concerns for anyone willing to consider the
    strong man versions of their perspective. </p>
  <p> Women have their own sport leagues specifically because they do not have
    the same physical advantages as men. Women with DSD have some level of male
    genetics that appear to grant them some advantage over women without.
    Barring women with DSD can be seen as working in the “spirit” that initially
    led to the development of female only sports leagues.</p>
  <p> Conversely, women with DSD are women. They often have female genitalia,
    were raised female and feel as though they are female. Sexual development is
    a spectrum from female to male with many resulting possibilities. In the
    world of elite athletic performance, it’s those genetic advantages that
    often give athletes the edge needed to compete. The case of the women
    outlined here, that edge may come from a Y chromosome. Is it fair to force
    them to suppress that if it’s their natural state?</p>
  <p> These aren’t frivolous positions. They reflect real fears about exclusion,
    fairness, and identity—but the conversation rarely treats them with that
    seriousness. Instead, each side reaches for the easiest target, painting the
    other as either bigoted or delusional. That kind of discourse isn’t just
    unhelpful—it’s dishonest.</p>
  <p>We have to stop asking <em>who</em> deserves to be heard, and start asking
    <em>what truths</em> each perspective brings to the table. The crisis isn’t
    about who belongs in women’s sports—it’s that we’ve built a binary system in
    a non-binary world, and neither side is ready to admit just how fragile that
    foundation really is.</p>
  <p><strong>My (very biased) Take</strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong>For me, this issue is on much firmer footing than the
    transgender debate, because this is a natural state for these women, but
    honestly, in both cases, I don’t see these women as having a definitive
    advantage over typically genetic women.</p>
  <p> I’ll set aside the debate on trans women in sports for another day (see
    you in the comments!) but when I compare the two groups, it seems like DSD
    women are more likely to perform better than transwomen, but they are still
    firmly in the category of female. The most striking example is Caster
    Semenya. She holds records in 6 of the 10 track and field events in her
    classification. In the 800 meters—her strongest event—she beat the
    competition by nearly two full seconds. That’s huge in elite sport, where
    medals are often decided by hundredths of a second. And yet? She wouldn’t
    even qualify for elite male high school finals.</p>
  <p> The concern is that these women have an unfair advantage, but why is their
    advantage disqualifying when others aren’t. </p>
  <p>Katie Ledecky, like Michael Phelps, has a killer combo of natural traits:
    high VO₂ max, a long torso, short legs, and unusually low blood lactate
    levels. That’s a genetic cocktail made for swimming. It helped her beat the
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/World_record_progression_800_metres_freestyle#Short_course_2:~:text=%5B13%5D-,52,Olympic,-Games">next-fastest
      swimmer not named Ledecky</a> by over nine seconds. Should we ask her to
    take supplements to raise her lactate levels, just to level the playing
    field?</p>
  <p> Simone Biles has the advantage by being one of the shortest and most
    muscular gymnasts. Her stature gives her a lower center of gravity and
    faster rotation. Sure, she is on the low end of the “normal range” of female
    gymnasts, but she is right on the money for the average height of female
    gold-medal gymnasts that have won since 1970. No one is telling Simone Biles
    or other gold medalists that their height gives them undue advantage over 5
    foot athletes so they are too short for the ride.</p>
  <p> Elite athletes are full of genetic anomalies, but folks are only getting
    mad at a certain type of genetic advantage. And I’m not here to call those
    people bigoted, (although there are some that should certainly be charged
    accordingly…). Those people <em>are</em> getting at something. At some
    point, the differences <em>do</em> make a competition unbalanced and unfair.
    While many people think Semenya should be able to run against women, no one
    thinks Usain Bolt should. </p>
  <p>Fair competition was the main reason for separating sports into male and
    female categories. The problem is, that isn't binary, it's a spectrum, and
    at some point on that spectrum, a person’s physiology crosses over into a
    zone we culturally code as “male.” At some point, it <em>is</em> unfair to
    the women they compete against. Instead of having that conversation, people
    are lobbing slurs or denying a person their only known identity before they
    got sex tested.</p>
  <p> You want to know another uncomfortable truth? The way we really find out
    when a female becomes male or what “unfair” means, is we do the damn thing.
    There is only so much testing and theorizing a person can do before they
    have to let shit rip and see how it works in the real world. We get long
    term data by looking at it – in the real world – for a long time. </p>
  <p> We also potentially have the population for it, at least in elite sports.
    Some research has shown that <a
      href="https://ouci.dntb.gov.ua/en/works/7WgROoL7/?utm">DSD is 140 times
      more prevalent</a> than it is in the normal female population. It's
    possible with numbers like that, and if there are real and persistent
    advantages to being a DSD, there can actually be a league of their own. Now,
    they would probably have to play against genetically typical women in
    non-elite sports until they got to an elite status. </p>
  <p>But honestly, I wouldn’t wish that on my worst enemy. </p>
  <p>Imane Khelif followed the rules. She won fair and square. And for that,
    half the world called her a man, a fraud, a threat. That’s the cost of being
    a DSD woman in sport. For decades, <a
