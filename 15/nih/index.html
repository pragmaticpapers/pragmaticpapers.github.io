  <p>Robert Francis Kennedy Jr. is a shining example of how the original was
    better. If you were not familiar with RFK Jr. and his silky-smooth voice
    before 2025, you probably are now. RFK Jr. is the totally normal<sup>1,
      2</sup> and not antivax<sup>3</sup> head of the Department of Health and
    Human Services (HHS). You have probably read or heard that the situation for
    all the agencies that fall under HHS, of which there are many<sup>4</sup>,
    is not good, but exactly how and why everything is bad can be hard to follow
    and understand. Some agencies have a self-evident impact, like the CDC with
    public health and the FDA with food safety, but what about the NIH? Here we
    will try to understand the direct impacts to one specific agency, the
    National Institutes of Health, and the research infrastructure it supports.
  </p>
  <p><em>Here I will mention that I have a clear stake in his. My conflict of
      interest is that I am currently, and for most of my adult life have been,
      NIH grant funded. As an employee of a university lab my salary has at
      times come from start-up funds and DoD grants, but the major funding
      source is and always has been the NIH.</em></p>
  <p><strong>Introducing the National Institutes of Health</strong>

  </p>
  <p>The National Institutes of Health (NIH) is <strong>the </strong>US
    government agency that is responsible for biomedical research and has been
    around in its most recognizable form since 1938 in Bethesda, MD<sup>5</sup>.
    Made up of 27 institutes and centers (ICs)<sup>6</sup>, the NIH funds both
    intramural research performed on its campuses as well as extramural research
    grants across the country and the globe<sup>7</sup>. ICs like the NIA
    (National Institute on Aging) and NIEHS (National Institute of Environmental
    Health Sciences) primarily fund and/or perform research in their specific
    research areas, while others like the NLM (National Library of Medicine)
    which runs PubMed, perform more research adjacent functions.</p>
  <p><strong>The NIH is good actually</strong></p>
  <p>The NIH is the global leader in biomedical research funding, to the tune of
    $33 billion in fiscal year 2022, dwarfing all other sources that report
    their investments<sup>8</sup>. It’s not like NIH keeps this money either,
    the majority of money spent by the NIH is grants to outside
    investigators<sup>81</sup>. These expenses result in contributions to 99.4%
    of all FDA drug approvals<sup>9</sup> and a clear economic return: $2.56 in
    economic activity generated for every dollar of funding<sup>10</sup>. What
    would also be interesting for anyone seriously interested in geopolitical
    power and diplomacy is the historical leverage of science as soft
    power<sup>11</sup>.

  </p>
  <p><strong>Why fuck it up?</strong></p>
  <p>What would motivate a political party to kneecap a huge draw of scientific
    skill globally and a great source of soft power? This is all really down to
    the “fuck you I got mine” mentality of Russel Vought<sup>107</sup> but a
    look through Project 2025 will tell you they're very focused on traditional
    families, abortion bad, and woke shit<sup>12</sup>. Another motivator
    unsurprisingly is (still) COVID and being mad about Fauci. The thin veneer
    of justifications can be summarized as corruption, and like most of these
    sorts of claims it takes a fair bit of work to unpack and understand before
    discarding. You can read my <a href="#hiee5jpq93v9">cursory attempt at that
      here</a> but suffice to say it can be dismissed as intellectually
    bankrupt. Unfortunately, these arguments can be persuasive to a general
    public because basic research takes approximately <em>forever</em> to have
    any practical application, with all of the intermediate results being
    boring/weird/complicated, and scientists being notoriously poor
    communicators. These flaws and failures have kept us as a society from being
    able to meaningfully combat the truly nonpartisan proliferation of
    anti-science sentiments, culminating in where we are now.</p>
  <p><strong><s>Hamstringing</s> Killing the American Scientific
      juggernaut</strong></p>
  <p>The anti-science agenda of the Trump administration is clear to any serious
    observer. Scientists looking to get out (of the US), the removal of real
    leadership and scientists, and obvious early examples of cronyism set a
    precedent<sup>106-109</sup>. There is no elegant way to go through the depth
    and breadth of the disaster happening at the NIH and by extension
    effectively all research programs affiliated with American universities. The
    topics involved are not only the minutiae of the administration and
    execution of scientific research, but also the intersection with political
    procedure and ideology. In many ways these topics are interconnected but,
    nevertheless, here we will try to broadly categorize how Trump 2.0 is
    successfully ending American scientific progress.</p>
  <p><strong>Installing new Leaders</strong></p>
  <p>New leadership is not uncommon following presidential transitions; The NIH
    director is a presidentially appointed position after all. This process
    started back in November 2024 with the nomination of Jayanta “Jay”
    Bhattacharya for the position of NIH Director. Following the transition of
    power, however, the first new face is a longtime NIAID researcher, Matthew
    Memoli. Named acting director of the NIH, this is probably not based on his
    (lack of) experience, considering a former NIGMS director stated Memoli
    would not have made his “short list or long list or the list at all really".
    No, it’s much more likely a result of his vocal anti-vaccine mandate stance
    during COVID<sup>28, 29</sup>.</p>
  <p>Memoli becomes number 2 as Bhattacharya is confirmed as the NIH director;
    unfortunately, it’s hard to overstate how much this guy sucks (58-72). The
    mere nomination by Trump is a black mark, but in that nomination the Great
    Barrington Declaration is unsurprisingly referenced<sup>111</sup>. For the
    uninitiated, the Great Barrington Declaration was an opinion of three
    academics that advocated for the let 'er rip approach to COVID in early
    October of 2020, this was roundly criticized by both scientists and the
    literal town of Great Barrington where the “Declaration” was
    written<sup>64,66, 67, 71</sup>.

    <span class="caption">Andrew Harnik/Getty Images from source 97</span>
  </div>
  </p>
  <p>Unsurprisingly Bhattacharya is real big on “free speech” in the context of
    COVID, but maybe we can look past that, is Bhattacharya qualified for the
    job? Well, he is <em>technically</em> a physician-scientist in that he is an
    MD-PhD but has never practiced medicine or done any post-med school clinical
    training<sup>61</sup>. His education aside from the MD is three economics
    degrees (BA, MA, PhD) from Stanford, and while he has an impressively
    lengthy publication list<sup>62,63</sup>, he also lists many commentaries
    and op-eds that are nakedly pandering to the anti-lockdown crowd. He was the
    corresponding author (most senior author) on a 2020 pre-print paper (it was
    eventually published in 2021) that looked at seroprevalence (the level of
    infection of a population) of COVID in Santa Clara, that got a ton of
    attention for all the flaws it had<sup>50,70, 72 </sup>and notable outlets
    like Zero Hedge and The Epoch Times liked to reference it. This might give
    you an indication of how things are going to go.</p>
  <p><strong>The Matt and Jay Show<br /></strong></p>
  <p>Memoli was appointed on January 24<sup>th</sup>, followed by Bhattacharya’s
    confirmation<sup>58</sup> on March 25<sup>th</sup>, but make no mistake that
    both men entirely cosign all the actions that have preceded their
    ascendancy. What we are seeing now is likely the biggest disaster in
    American Science. Before January, I think most scientists or researchers
    would not have hesitated to tell you their critiques of the NIH, but in my
    opinion all previous issues become indistinguishable from background noise
    when compared to the scope of what is happening now. It is cliché, but this
    is a cancer that has started at the NIH and will quickly metastasize
    nationwide</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>NIH Necrosis</strong></p>
  <p>Necrosis is when cells in tissue die prematurely; this often happens inside
    large cancerous tumors because of lack of nutrients. Necrotic tumors
    frequently indicate aggressive cancers, metastasis and poor survival.</p>
  <p>Under Memoli and Bhattacharya, the rot at the NIH has been quickly obvious.
    Longtime leaders leave or are pushed out, staff are removed illegally and
    barriers are put in place to make it difficult to retain talent. Large
    NIH-lead programs are cancelled while redundant offices are created, and
    research is funded as quid pro quo while HHS and DOGE propose massive budget
    cuts.</p>
  <p>Travel and hiring freezes are instituted, and NIH research is quickly
    disrupted with supplies unable to be ordered<sup>17</sup>.</p>
  <p>Significant departures from the NIH include Francis Collins, the Director
    from 2009-2021, who had a lab at NHGRI<sup>53</sup>, Eric Green, the
    director of NHGRI<sup>54</sup>, and Lawrence Tabak, the number 2 guy at the
    NIH since 2010. Tabak decided to leave rather than take the meaningless
    advisory role assigned to him by HHS<sup>36, 37</sup>, and was shortly
    followed out by Michael Lauer, the Deputy Director for Extramural
    Research<sup>38</sup>, who seems to have been fired after directing grant
    managers to start issuing grants again<sup>39-41</sup>.</p>
  <p>It isn’t just big names though, probationary workers, which include
    promoted and reassigned workers, start getting illegal form letter
    terminations from OPM on Valentine’s Day<sup>42-47</sup>, while employees
    hired under Title 42 which allows payment above the federal pay scale have
    their renewals put on hold<sup>51, 52</sup> and external scientists that
    evaluate internal NIH research proposals and performance are
    removed<sup>55</sup>.</p>
  <p>Major reductions in force (RIFs) start on April 1<sup>st</sup>, with the
    expectation that 1,200 people will be cut<sup>74</sup>, and 4 institute
    directors (NIAID, NIMHD, NINR, NHGRI) are also removed<sup>75</sup>. RIFs
    have an entire procedure outlined by OPM which were most likely not followed
    here. Many of those RIF’d include communications and procurement workers,
    and allegedly the FOIA office at the Office of the Director<sup>49</sup>. It
    goes without saying that any abrupt workforce change will cause disruptions,
    but the reductions here are wide-ranging. How does an agency function
    without proper IT staffing? How long can research continue with only the
    supplies on hand? Who do all these people let go contact when the HR people
    are gone?</p>
  <p>Getting rid of good workers isn’t enough for this administration, good
    long-term programs are on the chopping block too. The Safe to Sleep
    campaign, which has been around since 1994 and mostly been about bringing
    awareness to and preventing SIDS<sup>92</sup>, loses the support of the
    NIH<sup>93</sup>. The Diabetes Prevention Program (DPP) a big study on
    diabetes started in 2001<sup>56</sup> with an outcomes study with long-term
    follow-ups is discontinued<sup>57</sup>. This is probably related to Trump’s
    vindictive grant cancellations at Columbia.</p>
  <p>There does seem to be room in the budget for Bhattacharya to establish a
    new (redundant) office at the NIH to reduce animal use in
    research<sup>94</sup>, as if researchers don’t already use as few animals as
    possible,</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Even with all the staff reductions the NIH is still a target for budget
    cuts. DOGE asks them to cut a paltry $2.6 billion from their internal
    spending, this amounts to 35% of their funding<sup>79-81</sup> and the HHS
    draft budget leaks showing a proposed reduction from the 27 ICs to 8 as well
    as a &gt;40% cut to the entire NIH budget<sup>82, 83,100</sup>.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Bhattacharya is a failure in his role as NIH director by not being an
    advocate for this agency. He says that the <strong>proposed 40% NIH budget
      cut</strong> is totally chill or whatever, because it’s part of the
    negotiation process. And he’s totally pro-academic freedom (free speech),
    because NIH not <strong><em>funding</em></strong> specific research doesn’t
    mean they’re saying you can’t <strong><em>do</em></strong> that
    research<sup>91</sup>. Did I mention this guy sucks?</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p>Remember Memoli? The now Deputy Director of the NIH is getting $500 million
    to try making a universal flu vaccine using tech from the 70s<sup>110</sup>.
    This is an absurd amount of funding for one project, and “is clearly someone
    taking advantage of the system”<sup>108</sup>. So as long as you are aligned
    ideologically with the Trump administration and are useful you might get
    something in return. This usefulness doesn’t extend to the Clinical Center,
    the NIH Research hospital, which is limping along because of Trump
    policies<sup>105</sup> or the National Cancer Institute<sup>104</sup>.
    Science is not a person to be manipulated, but a process of discovery, and
    as such it doesn’t serve the Trump administration unless they can
    specifically pick and choose to fund only what, and who, they want.</p>
  <p> </p>
  <p><strong>Metastasis</strong></p>
  <p>Cancer cells can detach from the main tumor, enter the bloodstream and
    spread throughout the body, creating secondary tumors and often dramatically
    reducing survivability.

  </p>
  <p>The rot rapidly radiated out of the NIH almost immediately following the
    inauguration of Donald Trump. The HHS-wide communications freeze was
    probably the worst part; it prevented meetings of study sections and
    advisory councils, the first and second levels of the arduous grant review
    process<sup>13, 14</sup>. The HHS memo instituting the communications pause
    importantly prohibits publication to the Federal Register where public
    notices of study section meetings need to be published before they are
    allowed to happen, this continues through February with directions coming
    “from the White House, most likely OMB and Vought"<sup>15, 16, 48</sup>.</p>
  <p>No registrations, no meetings. No meetings, no new grants.</p>
  <p>Next existing grants are targeted.</p>
  <p>The OMB (Office of Management and Budget) releases a memo<sup>18</sup>
    freezing all federal grants. In the memo is “pausing disbursement”, which
    means not sending funds for grants already awarded. Additionally, grants
    start getting terminated. This is historically, very rare, "reserved only
    for gross misconduct, poor performance or fraud"<sup>20</sup>. This is all
    in service of the President’s Executive Order<sup>21</sup>, so anything
    “DEI” is the first target; while the NIH also starts putting a list together
    of grants that fight “misinformation or disinformation”, likely targets for
    cancelation<sup>73</sup>.</p>
  <p>Shocking no one who was listening, “DEI” grant programs are discontinued
    including a prestigious diversity related grant program started in
    1989<sup>31</sup>; not a surprise but is nonetheless sad.</p>
  <p>In response to the OMB memo freezing all federal funding, two separate
    lawsuits are immediately filed against the administration in Rhode Island
    and in the District of Columbia followed immediately by an administrative
    stay of the OMB memo, but unfortunately compliance with the memo has already
    started<sup>22-24</sup>. The next day the administration rescinds the memo
    directing the freeze of funding, but not the freeze itself<sup>19, 25,
      26</sup>. They’re being cute.</p>
  <p>The first TRO is issued for the OMB memo<sup>27</sup>; this is quickly
    followed by a second TRO.</p>
  <p>The grant fuckery continues, if a university has funds frozen by the
    administration, they won’t get any new grants<sup>86</sup>; and absolutely
    no grants to universities with “DEI” programs<sup>87-89</sup>. More
    bureaucratic hurdles to grant funding are introduced. One rumor quickly
    confirmed to be true is the ending of foreign subawards. This will prevent
    NIH funding going to institutions outside the United States, which will
    hamper international collaborative research and clinical trials<sup>98</sup>
    .Separately, DOGE introduces Defend the Spend, a new innovative efficient
    roadblock where for every drawdown of funds, the institution must justify
    spending<sup>90</sup>. This essentially means for institutions <em>already
      awarded</em> funding, they have to do an additional step of justification
    whenever they need to actually access those funds.

  </div>
  </p>
  <p>Did I mention that Jayanta Bhattacharya sucks?</p>
  <p>Bhattacharya is interviewed by Science and does a little bit of lying, a
    little bit of victim blaming<sup>97</sup>. All the restrictions coming from
    the NIH are “panicked overreaction” to directives they’re given. He not only
    said that the story about ending foreign subawards was “false” (it
    wasn’t<sup>99</sup>), but had the <em>balls</em> to chastise the reporter
    for “reporting rumors” going on to say that “the leaks don’t actually
    reflect what’s happening. Don’t write about rumors“. This was literally the
    morning of the day of the foreign subaward announcement.</p>
  <p>All my homies hate Jayanta Bhattacharya.</p>
  <p>In April at least NIH grant meetings can start again<sup>84</sup>, oh wait
    DOGE can apparently control grant <em>awarding</em> because they control
    grants.gov now<sup>85</sup>.</p>
  <p>There is an announcement of a 15% cap on indirect costs for research
    grants<sup>32</sup>. This on its own would devastate scientific progress in
    America.</p>
  <p>Indirect costs in research are all costs that are not directly research
    related (obviously). Things like utilities and maintenance of buildings.
    Indirect costs are negotiated between institutions and the NIH, for my
    institution it is 53%</p>
  <p>It's important to point out that indirect costs are calculated <strong>in
      addition </strong>to direct costs. If an institution has a negotiated IDC
    rate of 30%, and a PI at that institution is awarded a grant for $1 million,
    the actual amount awarded would be $1.3 million. The administration is
    either lying or stupid or both here. The argument is that reducing the IDC
    rate increases funds to researchers but this is obviously a lie. For that
    hypothetical PI getting a $1 million grant, the total award would just be
    $150,000 less to the institution.</p>
  <p>In response to the 15% indirect cap thankfully a (say it with me) lawsuit
    is filed, and a TRO is basically immediately granted to block the indirect
    cost cap<sup>33-35</sup>, this is followed by a permanent injunction which
    is of course immediately appealed<sup>77, 78</sup>.</p>
  <p>In line with trying to starve out science, NIH disabled the automatic
    no-cost extension “temporarily”<sup>101, 102</sup>. A no-cost extension is
    required when a project will continue past the initial proposed end date,
    but does not require any additional funding. Now this will trigger a manual
    review<sup>103</sup>, basically so NIH can filter out things it doesn’t
    like.</p>
  <p><strong>Prognosis</strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong></p>
  <p>It’s bad what do you want me to say? The small consolations in all of this
    are the States and, now that Harvard finally grew a spine<sup>96</sup>,
    institutions have filed lawsuits against the administration. Unfortunately,
    law and science are both slow moving processes and the negative consequences
    of these actions are already apparent, though they will likely continue for
    decades. In the past we have had smart, thoughtful, articulate leadership at
    HHS and NIH, but now that is unfortunately not the case. While some had said
    that Bhattacharya was the “least bad” option to head the NIH, others have
    seen the unfortunate writing on the wall<sup>30</sup>. Bhattacharya is a
    weak and cowardly leader who views the role of NIH director as a burden and
    does not have the respect of the scientists that work under him<sup>76,
      95</sup>. Like many “free speech” advocates, he is only really concerned
    with speech he agrees with, going so far to start a new scientific
    journal<sup>69</sup> where only people in the associated
    “Academy”<sup>68</sup> can publish, and to join that Academy you need to be
    nominated or invited by a current member. This is the obvious incubation of
    a misinformation generating echo chamber and Jayanta has shown previously
    that he has no problem pushing conspiracies and pseudoscience on various
    substack platforms<sup>60</sup>. At an AEI sponsored symposium<sup>59</sup>
    in 2024, Bhattacharya spoke about the reform needed in public health,
    pointing to desired increased transparency, decentralization, and
    depoliticization. There are of course lies. Under Bhattacharya the NIH has
    become increasingly opaque with power concentrated by political figures for
    political purposes. My personal hope is that enough of the general public
    cares about science and can be activated politically to move congress and
    eventually the next president to correct the mistakes made and get science
    in America on life support.</p><a id="hiee5jpq93v9"></a>
  <p>Supplementary Information</p>
  <p><strong>Project 2025 claims of corruption at NIH</strong></p>
  <p>This starts with a WaPo story from 2018 about a large study on alcohol
    consumption, the preliminary talks for which probably violated NIH policy,
    there were hearings on this (1, 2). </p>
  <p>Then it's of course COVID + corruption</p>
  <p><strong>1. NIH being on the Moderna patent is a conflict of interest
      (COI).</strong></p>
  <p>Claiming this is corrupt/a COI and pointing to a CBS news story that is
    basically saying the opposite, with the watchdog group cited in the story
    literally arguing that NIH scientists should be on the patent (3, 4). Wild
    to claim that the work done by NIH scientists should never be credited to
    them though patents.</p>
  <p><strong>2. NIH conducted Moderna clinical trials internally instead of
      funding grants for external clinical trials and this is a COI.</strong>
  </p>
  <p>The (literal antivax advocacy group) source they cite says that "NIAID used
    taxpayer dollars to sponsor, assume responsibility for, and perform the
    first clinical trial of this vaccine" (5). A cursory look at the clinical
    trial information will show you that it was performed at 3 sites: NIH,
    Kaiser Permanente Washington Health Research Institute, and Emory University
    (6). So, on its face the claim is incorrect as it was collaborative to begin
    with.</p>
  <p><strong>3. NIH has a monopoly on directing research, this is
      corrupt.</strong></p>
  <p>The implication is that there are a few people directing where all research
    funding goes. For the uninformed this sounds like all grants are reviewed by
    the same people, they are not. To oversimplify: grant review panels are
    called study sections, and they are organized by general scientific area
    (review branch), study sections are more specific, and you can find the
    members and affiliations for each study section at the CSR website (7). For
    example, the Basic Cancer Immunobiology study section has 32 members for the
    most recent review dates and is in the Basic and Translational Cancer Review
    Branch. There are 205 standing study sections if i counted correctly.</p>
  <p>4. <strong>Bonus meme: NIH foundation should be decommissioned</strong></p>
  <p>They are here referring to the Foundation for the NIH (FNIH) is a 501(c)(3)
    that allows private fundraising for the NIH and had about $65 million in
    revenue vs about $77 million in expenses, about 90% of which went to
    research programs (8). Relative to the total funding of the NIH, this
    amounts to a rounding error, in fiscal 2022 that would be 0.2% of all NIH
    funding, so what does that matter? If you can say that money distributed
    from the FNIH is controlled inappropriately, by extension the uninformed
    will understand that money distributed from the <em>NIH</em> is controlled
    inappropriately, which is obviously false.</p>
