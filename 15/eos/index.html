  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

      Order 14303 - Restoring Gold Standard Science</a></p>
  <p>Signed: 5/23/2025</p>
  <p>Published: 5/29/2025</p>
  <p>Section 1 talks a bunch of shit about the scientific community. It
    complains about Covid 19, whales, climate change, and DEI. It goes on to say
    that they want to return to a gold standard of science.</p>
  <p>Section 2 establishes definitions for the EO.</p>
  <p>Section 3 requires agencies to conform to the gold standard of science
    meaning science conducted in a manner that is: </p>
  <p>(i) reproducible;</p>
  <p>(ii) transparent;</p>
  <p>(iii) communicative of error and uncertainty;</p>
  <p>(iv) collaborative and interdisciplinary;</p>
  <p>(v) skeptical of its findings and assumptions;</p>
  <p>(vi) structured for falsifiability of hypotheses;</p>
  <p>(vii) subject to unbiased peer review;</p>
  <p>(viii) accepting of negative results as positive outcomes; and</p>
  <p>(ix) without conflicts of interest.</p>
  <p>Section 4 forbids misconduct by federal employees, and to make scientific
    data public unless prohibited by law.</p>
  <p>Section 5 revokes Biden era policies regarding scientific integrity and to
    revert to Trump 1 era guidance except when it conflicts with this EO.</p>
  <p>Section 6 states this EO applies to all federal employees involved in the
    generation, use, interpretation, or communication of scientific information.
  </p>
  <p>Section 7 orders agency heads to establish processes and guidance to
    implement this EO. It orders processes be put into place to to correct
    scientific information pursuant to the <a
      href="https://www.cio.gov/handbook/it-laws/information-quality-act/">Information
      Quality Act</a>.</p>
  <p>Section 8 allows for agency heads to apply for a waiver to this EO.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO focuses heavily on the promulgation, use, and accreditation of
    scientific information. This topic has been in the public eye for almost a
    decade at this point, and has become incredibly political. As Section 1
    points out, there are many scientific topics that are contested, largely
    only by conservative pundits, and have become central to the identity of
    conservative political thought. This EO attempts to control every point at
    which the government interacts with scientific information and how it
    distributes it to the public. As the Government is the largest funder of
    scientific research, this affects almost every scientific discipline and
    field in the world.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forwards</strong></p>
  <p>This is one of many EOs that is attempting to enforce MAGA double speak.
    There is nothing in this EO that will increase the quality or veracity of
    scientific data or research. Instead it simply gives the Administration more
    control over scientific research and information. The Administration is
    making it clear that they are not interested in science, but controlling it
    to their advantage.</p>

      Order 14302 - Reinvigorating the Nuclear Industrial Base</a></p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 spends time lauding the US’s history of nuclear development and
    how recently it has fallen short.</p>
  <p>Section 2 states that it is the policy of the US to expedite and promote
    nuclear energy production and support the opening of new facilities.</p>
  <p>Section 3 orders various Secretaries and Executive Officials to coordinate
    and provide recommendations on how to better facilitate and strengthen the
    domestic nuclear fuel cycle.</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders the building of new facilities, restarting of closed
    facilities, and the integration of nuclear energy into the military.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders that nuclear engineers and other careers that are needed
    for the expansion and maintenance of nuclear energy facilities be
    prioritized in <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-04-28/pdf/2025-07369.pdf">EO
      14278</a>. It also orders Executive Officers to facilitate grants,
    training, and education in these fields.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>There is little subtext to this EO. It very directly wishes to support and
    facilitate the increase of nuclear energy in America. While this is a
    laudable effort, it contains little substance, merely ordering various
    departments to “facilitate” or “coordinate” to increase nuclear energy
    production.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>This EO will likely not provide sufficient or even significant impact to
    the nuclear energy market in America. These facilities cost hundreds of
    millions to billions to set up, and require massive and long term
    infrastructure to maintain. Investors in nuclear energy look for stability
    before working on projects, and the actions of this Administration are
    anything but stable. </p>
  <p>It is notable that so many sections of this EO cut against other policies
    of the Administration: expansion of research grants, expansion of education
    and training, foreign trade, and renewable energy. While nuclear energy is
    an important and useful form of energy production, the EO is likely a clear
    sign to the Administration’s capture to special interest donors.</p>
  <p><a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-29/pdf/2025-09799.pdf">Executive

  <p><a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-29/pdf/2025-09799.pdf">Energy</a>
  </p>
  <p>Section 1 also spends some time talking about how great US nuclear
    technology and energy production used to be. </p>
  <p>Section 2 defines terms for the EO.</p>
  <p>Section 3 delegates the design, construction, operation, and disposition of
    advanced reactors to be under the authority and jurisdiction of the
    Department of Energy</p>
  <p>Section 4 outlines new procedures and orders new guidance to be issued
    regarding test reactors and approval for test reactors.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the creation of a pilot program for reactor construction
    and operation outside of the National Laboratories and orders at least three
    reactors be approved for this pilot program by July 4, 2026.</p>
  <p>Section 6 orders various officials to ensure that the EPA includes
    exceptions to facilitate this EO.</p>
  <p>Section 7 orders that the Department of Energy’s DOGE team be involved with
    implementing this EO.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO in conjunction with the other nuclear EOs from this week, is
    focused on the nuclear energy market. This is more focused on promulgating
    and expanding nuclear energy.</p>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/image1.png" alt="Image 1" />
    <span class="caption"></span>
  </div>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>Not much more to say than what has been said previously. This EO does
    however take the testing of new types of reactors further out from under the
    government’s eye. As with most other EOs from this Administration, its heavy
    focus on deregulation could lead to serious harm down the road.</p>
  <p><a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-29/pdf/2025-09798.pdf">Executive
      Order 14300 - Ordering the Reform of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission</a>
  </p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 discusses the history of the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)
    and how they are too safe and risk averse. According to the EO, this has led
    to an unnecessary restriction of the American nuclear energy market.</p>
  <p>Section 2 states it is the US policy to facilitate and increase domestic
    nuclear energy production.</p>
  <p>Section 3 tries to augment the congressional mandate under the <a
      href="https://www.congress.gov/118/plaws/publ67/PLAW-118publ67.pdf">Accelerating
      Deployment of Versatile, Advanced Nuclear for Clean Energy Act of 2024,
      Public Law 118-67, Sec. 501(a)</a>, and include a mandate to consider the
    benefits of increased availability of nuclear energy.</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders that the NRC undergo a reduction in force and facilitate
    this EO.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the NRC in conjunction with its DOGE team and the OMB to
    review its regulations and guidance and try to reduce them to help more
    rapidly deploy licenses for nuclear energy, and remove unnecessary
    regulations. It orders that they reevaluate radiation limits. </p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This is a sister EO to EO 14300, EO 14301, and 14299, and is attempting to
    help clear out bureaucratic roadblocks to establishing more nuclear
    facilities.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>There isn’t much to say here that wasn’t said about the previous two EO.
    This EO does more aggressively call out specific regulations, i.e.
    readjusting safe radiation levels. This EO also appears to be challenging
    the congressional mandate of the NRC, a direct challenge to congressional
    delegation powers. It is likely that this EO will be challenged in court,
    and those provisions attempting to change the Congressional mandate will
    likely be struck down.</p>

      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/FR-2025-05-29/pdf/2025-09796.pdf">National
      Security</a></p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 talks about the national security crisis that could come from
    America’s lack of nuclear energy facilities.</p>
  <p>Section 2 states that it is US policy to facilitate advanced nuclear
    technologies to support national security objectives. </p>
  <p>Section 3 orders the Secretary of the Army and Defense to establish a
    program for the utilization of nuclear energy for domestic military bases.
  </p>
  <p>Section 4 orders the Secretary of Energy to initiate a process for AI data
    centers to be connected to the necessary infrastructure to receive nuclear
    energy. </p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the Secretary of Energy to take stock of all uranium and
    nuclear materials in the US stockpiles. It also places a focus on recyclable
    nuclear materials and establishing new recycling processes.</p>
  <p>Section 6 orders the Secretaries of Defense and Energy to coordinate and
    find ways to promote nuclear energy for military readiness.</p>
  <p>Section 7 orders that the building of Nuclear energy be exempt from EPA
    requirements.</p>
  <p>Section 8 orders the Secretary of State to facilitate more nuclear exports
    via 123 Agreements under the <a
      href="https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/2153">Atomic Energy Act
      of 1954</a>.</p>
  <p>Section 9 orders the prioritization of security clearance distributions as
    needed to facilitate this EO.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO appears to be focusing primarily on expanding nuclear energy via a
    national security approach. With the other three EOs regarding nuclear
    energy, it appears to form a scattershot attempt at supporting new nuclear
    energy and deregulating the industry. By attacking this issue from so many
    angles, something is bound to survive a judicial challenge.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>While the military has, and does, implement nuclear energy where it finds
    it useful, it is not clear how this EO will enable them in some way that
    they were not before. More telling is the provision regarding AI data
    centers. It is likely that this EO will be to the benefit of tech
    billionaires and the AI sycophants that helped get JD Vance into the
    whitehouse.</p>
  <p>Section 9 is particularly concerning, as it appears to functionally lower
    the standards of issuing security clearances, specifically clearances
    concerning nuclear materials. While it may be over speculative, it is not
    ridiculous to say that this action could lead to the leak of nuclear
    material and technology in the future.</p>
