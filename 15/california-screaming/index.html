  <p>Over the weekend, tensions between Donald Trump and California, the world’s
    4th largest economy, have come to a head. On Friday, reports came out that
    the Trump admin was mulling over <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/06/politics/trump-california-federal-funding">the
      cancellation of federal funding for the University of California and
      California State University systems.</a> These cuts, which would affect
    schools like UCLA and San Diego State University, would be due to the
    school’s “antisemitism” according to sources at CNN. The Trump admin has
    done similar moves with other schools such as <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/05/13/us/harvard-funding-cuts-government-trump">Harvard</a>
    and are facing lawsuits as a result. Universities in the UC and CSU systems
    are public however, so they may be more susceptible to the federal action on
    speech and civil rights than a private university like Harvard would be. The
    UC system itself is California’s 3rd largest employer and <a
      href="https://ucop.edu/communications/_files/uc-and-the-federal-government.pdf">conducts
      8% of all academic research in the country</a>. The Trump admin has
    already <a
      href="https://www.sacbee.com/opinion/op-ed/article304222786.html">frozen
      funding to the UC system</a>, among others in California. And while <a
      href="https://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/trump-funding-cuts-uc-berkeley-researchers-lawsuit-rcna206667">lawsuits
      are already underway</a> for those particular cuts, this could continue to
    freeze funds for months longer. <a
      href="https://x.com/GavinNewsom/status/1931087538565054849">Gavin
      Newsom</a> and other California democrats have floated the idea of
    withholding California’s federal taxes, but logistically this may be
    impossible so don’t count on it. It’s important to note that this round of
    cuts has not been officially announced by the Trump administration, but
    after the events that followed it may be inevitable. </p>
  <p>Beginning at 9:15 am on Friday, ICE began conducting raids across Los
    Angeles. Between the <a
      href="https://www.cbsnews.com/news/california-los-angeles-immigration-protests-trump/">Los
      Angeles Fashion District, a Home Depot parking lot,</a> and a clothing
    store they arrested anywhere from 40 to 100 immigrants, but the large raids
    would not go unnoticed. Demonstrators began to gather at several locations
    in the afternoon; the Metropolitan Detention Center in downtown L.A, a <a
      href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/federal-agents-raid-home-depot-in-westlake-district/">Home
      Depot in the Westlake District</a>, and at an “Ambiance Apparel” in the
    fashion district as well. At the Metropolitan Detention Center, where
    immigrants were being held overnight, hundreds of protestors gathered <a
      href="https://abc7.com/post/protesters-march-downtown-los-angeles-ice-immigration-raids-city/16681794/">peacefully
      according to multiple outlets</a>, until roughly 7:00pm when LAPD declared
    an unlawful assembly and used riot gear to disperse the crowd. Los Angeles
    Mayor Karen Bass released a statement condemning the immigration raids,
    saying, "these tactics sow terror in our communities and disrupt basic
    principles of safety in our city” as did Governor Gavin Newsom. “Continued
    chaotic federal sweeps, across California, to meet an arbitrary arrest quota
    are as reckless as they are cruel.”</p>
  <p>On June 7th, things didn't get better. In Paramount, <a
      href="https://youtu.be/Spep6Zi7kss?si=8y-SViCQ3kFzNcJ8">things began to
      boil over</a> as demonstrators confronted DHS officers near a Home Depot,
    drawing a crowd of roughly 1,000. Federal agents responded with flash-bang
    grenades and pepper balls after protesters blocked roads. At least two
    people were injured. Law enforcement issued a dispersal order by
    mid-afternoon. Tear gas was deployed, and one ICE agent was injured by a
    thrown rock going through a windshield (probably the one shown in the link
    above). A car was later set on fire, along with American flags according to
    reports. </p>

  <p>Demonstrations intensified downtown as protesters gathered outside the
    Metropolitan Detention Center, prompting police to establish a skirmish
    line. <a
      href="https://www.nbclosangeles.com/on-air/newschopper4-federal-officials-in-standoff-with-protesters-in-compton/3718139/">By
      nightfall, the protests had spread to Compton</a>, where demonstrators
    threw bottles containing a substance that smelled like gasoline. Earlier, <a
      href="https://ktla.com/news/local-news/that-can-kill-you-l-a-police-attacked-with-fireworks-rocks-molotov-cocktails/">two
      individuals were arrested on suspicion of assaulting policemen.</a> One
    had allegedly thrown a Molotov cocktail, which caused minor injuries to
    three sheriff’s deputies. </p>
  <p>Later that day, in an evening interview on Fox News, White House official
    and “border czar” Tom Homan announced that the National Guard would be
    deployed to Los Angeles. Later that night, President Donald Trump signed a
    memorandum ordering 2,000 members of the California National Guard into the
    city. Invoking 10 U.S.C. § 12406, Trump <a
      href="https://archive.is/20250609023358/https://www.washingtonpost.com/national-security/2025/06/08/trump-national-guard-la-protests-law/">bypassed
      the usual requirement for state approval</a>—marking the first time a
    president had deployed a state’s National Guard without gubernatorial
    consent since the <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Selma_to_Montgomery_marches">Selma to
      Montgomery marches in 1965</a>. Gavin Newsom would state his intent to <a
      href="https://thehill.com/regulation/court-battles/5339718-california-lawsuit-trump-national-guard/">sue
      the Trump administration </a>over this move on Sunday. He has criticized
    the move as “needlessly inflammatory” and it “would only escalate tensions”
    while at the same time urging protests to remain peaceful. Trump would also
    state the protests were started by “paid instigators” and declare a mask ban
    at protests on <a
      href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/posts/114646378582957392">Truth
      Social later Saturday night.</a></p>
  <p>On Sunday, <a
      href="https://abcnews.go.com/US/live-updates/la-immigration-protests-live-updates-trump-deploys-2000/?id=122621279">Roughly
      300 National Guard troops were stationed</a> at federal sites throughout
    the city, with 500 Marines on standby at Twentynine Palms, under orders from
    <a
      href="https://www.abc10.com/article/news/local/california/500-marines-prepared-to-deploy-to-los-angeles/103-067cd5e8-f7b1-4f1d-8dc5-233efd1584a9">Pete
      Hegseth</a>. Outside the Metropolitan Detention Center, federal forces
    used smoke and pepper spray to clear protestors and secure access for DHS
    and Border Patrol vehicles. By mid-afternoon, LAPD issued a tactical alert.
    Police authorized less-lethal munitions and labeled the gathering an
    unlawful assembly. Multiple arrests occurred near the Civic Center, and <a
      href="https://www.cnn.com/2025/06/08/us/video/los-angeles-protest-motorcycle-crash-police-line-digvid">two
      officers were injured when motorcyclists broke through a skirmish
      line.</a></p>
  <p>Tensions escalated <a
      href="https://www.cbsnews.com/losangeles/news/national-guard-troops-los-angeles-immigration-protests/">further
      when protesters blocked the US 101 freeway</a>, prompting a full closure.
    In the chaos, <a
      href="https://www.latimes.com/california/story/2025-06-08/waymo-vehicles-set-on-fire-protesters-police-clash">several
      Waymo driverless vehicles</a> were vandalized and torched. That evening,
    the LAPD declared Downtown Los Angeles an unlawful assembly zone, urging the
    public to leave the area immediately. At a Sunday evening press conference,
    LAPD Chief Jim McDonnell reported a total of 39 arrests tied to the
    protests—29 on Saturday and 10 more on Sunday—as the weekend came to a
    close. Not to be outdone, San Francisco had its own protests and SFPD
    announced <a href="https://x.com/SFPD/status/1931956246275621253">60 arrests
      were made Sunday night</a>.</p>
