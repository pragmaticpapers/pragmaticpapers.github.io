    <span class="caption">Adam Schiff. Jeffrey Goldberg. Leonard Leo. What do all three men have in
      common? While they may span the ideological spectrum, these three men were
      all crowned with the title “sleazebag” by the President of the United
      States.</span>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p>Adam Schiff being called one makes sense. He is a Democratic Senator from a
    staunchly blue state; he was the lead impeachment manager during Trump’s
    first impeachment trial, and he has repeatedly expressed his disapproval
    with the current administration. He does not sound like the type of guy
    Donald Trump is looking to embrace.</p>
  <p>For Jeffrey Goldberg, editor-in-chief of <em>The Atlantic</em>, being
    called a “sleazebag” also makes sense. Even without his breaking coverage of
    the Signalgate fiasco, the magazine he edits does not have the most
    favorable reputation among MAGA folks.</p>
  <p>But Leonard Leo? The leader of the <em>Federalist Society</em>, advisor to
    legally conservative legends like Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito, and
    staunch Republican Leonard Leo? What could Leo have possibly done to warrant
    this type of repudiation from the President of the United States?</p>
  <p>On May 28, a three-judge panel from the United States Court of
    International Trade put down Trump’s “liberation day” tariff plan, a plan
    which would have (seemingly randomly) placed massive tariffs on over a
    hundred countries. President Trump attempted to go through with these
    tariffs under his assumption that the International Emergency Powers Act of
    1977 allowed the Executive to declare and impose unilateral tariffs on
    trading partners around the world. The panel noted that the President does
    in fact, not have that power, and effectively put a block on Trump’s ability
    to upend global trade. In response, President Trump went on a massive tirade
    via his social media platform “Truth Social,” effectively calling these
    judges “traitors” and acting out of hatred, rather than a deep understanding
    of the power of the Executive. He writes:</p>
  <p><em>How is it possible for them to have potentially done such damage to the
      United States of America? Is it purely a hatred of “TRUMP?”</em></p>
  <p>While we can safely answer “no,” President Trump’s tirade touches on
    another aspect of this saga, one showcasing his disdain for the restraints
    placed upon his office and the breakaway of the new era Republican Party
    from traditionally conservative values. Donald Trump went after Leonard Leo,
    the leader of the conservative legal activist group The Federalist Society.
    The Federalist Society hosts thousands of conservative lawyers and believers
    in traditional conservative jurisprudential ideas. Five members of the
    current Supreme Court were part of The Federalist Society<em> </em>before
    they were placed upon the bench; Leonard Leo himself sat alongside Clarence
    Thomas during his tumultuous confirmation hearings.</p>
  <p>The President feels like he has been tricked by the Federalist Society into
    appointing judges who do not have the President’s agenda in mind. And he
    might be right — Federalist Society lawyers span widely in their views of
    the President; some are currently in jail for assisting Trump’s attempt to
    overturn the 2020 election, and others are issuing universal injunctions to
    stop Executive actions they view as illegal or unconstitutional. Trump, in
    his tirade, writes:</p>
  <p><em>I was new to Washington, and it was suggested that I use The Federalist
      Society as a recommending source on Judges. I did so, openly and freely,
      but then realized that they were under the thumb of a real “sleazebag”
      named Leonard Leo, a bad person who, in his own way, probably hates
      America, and obviously has his own separate ambitions.</em></p>
  <p>Calling Leo a “sleazebag” might not be the most inapt characterization of
    his political and legal career, but the accusation coming from the mouth of
    the President is a bigger deal than most are willing to admit. There is no
    doubt in my mind that Leo recommended lawyers and judges who he felt like
    could have played a part in Trump’s conservative revolution; Leo probably
    felt like originalist judges tend to serve Republican agendas better, and by
    recommending originalists, they would be able to usher in a new era of
    Republican rule. In part, Leo was correct. The overturning of <em>Roe v.
      Wade</em> was not just a massive victory for Republicans and
    conservatives, but it also highlighted a true step forward for the
    originalist movement — one who views certain Supreme Court decisions as
    “legislating from the bench” rather than diligently interpreting the
    Constitution.</p>
  <p>But what Leo might not have expected is that in Trump’s return to the White
    House following the 2024 election, anything goes. Constitutional restraints,
    judicial review, and attempts to stay within party lines were all thrown out
    of the window in the first one hundred days of the administration. Donald
    Trump learned from his first term the exact actions he had to take in order
    to make his second term much more legislatively impactful. In Leo’s attempts
    to subdue the Supreme Court’s power to “legislate from the bench,” he
    emboldened a President to legislate from the Oval Office; by coming after
    judges, signing outrageously unconstitutional executive orders, and subduing
    the power of the Legislature, President Trump is effectively coalescing
    governing power into one place, the Executive. Whoever stands in his way,
    including Leo and the Federalist Society, are enemies of the regime and
    obstacles to be destroyed.</p>
  <p>This signals more than just a break-up between the President and one legal
    advisor. This is a mask-off moment for the Republican Party, and a truly
    defining episode in their acceptance of totalitarian rule from conservative
    politicians in Washington. If the current Republican party does not seek
    policy prescriptions and legal opinions from the tenets of conservatism,
    where do they seek them from? Is it solely the word of President Trump? It
    increasingly seems like that might be the case.</p>
  <p><strong>The Society and Leo</strong></p>
  <p>The Federalist Society has a few major goals they aim to accomplish.
    Firstly, their commitment to the legal philosophies of textualism and
    originalism puts them at the forefront of conservative legal communities,
    often recommending judges to Republican administrations that they believe
    will further this jurisprudential theory. They attempt to shape the federal
    judiciary in a way that resembles a traditionally conservative one; by
    pushing for overturning liberal staples of the court, they inch our country
    towards a vision of the future that, they believe, is what the framers of
    the Constitution had in mind. Their massive legal network of conservative
    judges and lawyers puts them in a key position to act as a legal advisor to
    Presidents and members of Congress, intermixing the Republican Party with
    legal conservatives around the nation.</p>
  <p>In theory, Donald Trump should not be opposed to this. He has spoken highly
    of originalist pioneers such as Scalia, nominated textualists such as
    Gorsuch and Barrett to the Supreme Court, and has used the philosophy as a
    guiding light in his relationship with the Judiciary. But theory is one
    thing. The President has shown an outright disdain for the Constitution,
    arguing to suspend it when he sees fit. He has levied attacks against
    originalist judges who defy his agenda. He has signed and supported
    executive orders that go against core constitutional rights such as
    birthright citizenship. While on paper, President Trump should be a
    supporter of the Federalist Society and their attempts to usher in an era of
    originalism, his actions show that the only guiding light he seeks is that
    of his own authoritarian disposition.</p>
  <p>For those of us who have seen HBO’s hit show, <em>Game of Thrones</em>,
    Leonard Leo plays a role in Washington that is analogous to that of Tywin
    Lannister. While Tywin has a much more formidable role in Casterly Rock, his
    ability to play puppet-master from the shadows is what defines his
    similarity to Leonard Leo. Leo is the puppet-master of legal conservatism in
    Washington D.C. His access to a network of judges and lawyers from around
    the nation puts him in a position to advise the President on who should be
    nominated to federal judgeship positions. And for the most part, presidents
    take his word into account and appoint judges who match up with their
    agenda; Leo worked with Clarence Thomas when he was being appointed by H.W.,
    Leo worked with Bush in the nomination hearings for Justice Alito and
    Justice Roberts, and Leo advised President Trump during all of his Supreme
    Court nominations.</p>
  <p>So a life-long Republican, who started Cornell’s chapter of the Federalist
    Society, devoted his whole life to legal conservatism, and advised multiple
    other Republican presidents is now in the President’s crosshairs because
    some of his judges followed their textualist framework and halted the
    usurpation of Executive power. Why are Republicans not up in arms about
    this? Why are constitutional conservatives and originalists not speaking up
    about the degradation of conservative values in the Republican Party?</p>
  <p>One might say they are scared of Trump and his pushback. This can
    overwhelmingly be seen in the debates in the halls of Congress regarding the
    inaptly named “Big Beautiful Bill.” Republicans who hold true to their
    right-wing values have come out against the abomination, only to be told to
    quiet down and heed to the demands of President Trump. And while this
    explanation holds weight, it only really extends to supporters of the bill
    and Congressional Republicans. This does not explain why as of yet, even the
    Federalist Society itself has not responded to the affronts to their
    institution, as well as the values they hold dear.</p>
  <p>It is my summation that the Republican Party, at least jurisprudentially,
    is not a conservative party. It is not the party of textualism or
    originalism or whatever ideology comes out of the minds (and wallets) of the
    Koch Brothers. It is the party of Trump, and the legal philosophy of the
    party is Trumpism. Trump’s agenda takes precedence over traditional
    conservative values. This is not only shown in the consistent 5-4 or 6-3
    results of major SCOTUS cases in which constitutional questions are the main
    subject. This is shown through the silence of the Republican Party, en
    masse, regarding their response to attacks on jurisprudential conservative
    values. And even more intrinsically, this comes from the office of the
    Attorney General in her attempts to distance the American Bar Association
    from their duties in vetting federal judicial nominees.</p>
  <p><strong>Pam Bondi and the American Bar Association</strong></p>
  <p>The Department of Justice recently rescinded the ability of the American
    Bar Association to vet judicial nominees. This is a task that they have been
    undergoing since the mid-20th century, and have enjoyed access to non-public
    information in order to attest to the high-quality of judges. Attorney
    General Pam Bondi seems to be remiss to the fact that they have vetted and
    approved every single one of Trump’s SCOTUS picks and only rejected three of
    his over fifty federal judicial nominations. She speaks of the ABA with
    scorn and disdain, writing to the President of the ABA:</p>
  <p><em>Unfortunately, the ABA no longer functions as a fair arbiter of
      nominees’ qualifications, and its ratings invariably and demonstrably
      favor nominees put forth by Democratic Administrations</em></p>
  <p>While this is obviously untrue, it just goes to show that the current
    administration is committed to working within the restraints put upon it in
    order to ensure constitutional legitimacy.</p>
  <p>Furthermore, by furthering the ABA from the process of vetting judicial
    nominees, Pat Bondi and the Department of Justice are signaling that future
    nominations might not go to conservatives who believe in the values of the
    Constitution and are willing and able to uphold it. Instead, we may see
    sycophants who see the Judiciary as an obstacle that needs to be reduced in
    order to allow Trump to push his agenda.</p>
  <p>This is a defining moment in our country. Are we a nation of laws? Are we a
    nation of tyrants? We learn in school about the ideologies that the framers
    of the Constitution upheld and defended — do these values no longer matter?
    I, by no means, align with the jurisprudential ideologies of originalism,
    but I can see the value in regarding the Constitution with the respect and
    reverence of those like Scalia and Roberts. These values are gone. They are
    no longer staples of the Republican Party or of American conservatism in
    general. The Republican Party has turned into a cult of personality, where
    the limits placed upon the cult leader are obstacles to be squashed, not
    borders to be respected. And by distancing neutral organizations like the
    ABA from the process of vetting judicial nominees, the Republican Party has
    shown its true colors.</p>
  <p><strong>Cult or Party?</strong></p>
  <p>The Republican Party, for a while now, has been willingly giving President
    Trump more and more legislative powers. From supportive SCOTUS decisions to
    allowing the President to act as a whip in Congress, a large amount of power
    in Washington has flowed to Pennsylvania Avenue.</p>
  <p>This is one of the classic patterns we see while studying authoritarian
    takeovers of governments. Adolf Hitler vilified Weimar judges, calling them
    communists and leftist traitors — when the institution of the Weimar
    judiciary was weakest, the Nazis developed parallel courts called
    Volksgerichtshof which acted as a kangaroo court in order to further the
    Nazi agenda. Mussolini destroyed the independence of the Italian courts and
    created a fake “Special Tribunal for the Defense of the State” which purely
    acted out of fascist pressure to prosecute political opponents. Erdoğan in
    Turkey has purged thousands of members of the judiciary and created “terror
    courts” which are currently being used to jail journalists. The pattern is
    the same throughout history. We cannot allow the President to lead us down
    this path.</p>
  <p>And while the President is known to burn bridges and cut off key allies,
    something feels more nefarious about this interaction with Leo and the
    Federalist Society. It is not like a very public (and embarassing) spat with
    Elon Musk regarding their egos. It is not forcing someone out because their
    scandal is too politically damaging. Trump is coming after Leo because Leo
    is committed to conservative values. Leo’s commitment to conservative values
    (that many of us disagree with) will invariably get him in trouble with the
    President purely because of the fact that Donald Trump is not a conservative
    president. He does not look to the guiding principles of Buckley and Reagan
    as policy indicators. He does not believe in originalism and textualism. He
    believes in one thing and one thing only: himself.</p>
