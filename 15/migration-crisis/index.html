  <p>Ten Years later: The Migration Crisis That Shook Europe</p>
  <p>Thomas R Ullmann </p>
  <p>June 8th, 2025</p>
  <h2>Prologue</h2>
  <p>Whilst I favour the passive voice; with an emphasis on what can be said
    objectively, to write this article in such a way would be disingenuous.</p>
  <p>There is a personal aspect to this event. I remain in contact with many of
    those who fled in 2015. That year I was myself on the road - cycling on one
    of my Balkan adventures that encompassed much of the same route that
    refugees (as well as economic migrants) were taking. lt was a simple matter
    of chance. The initial plan to l spent days Belgrade, Serbia turned into
    several weeks. I attempted to document what I sore, both visually and
    through informal interviews; meeting people, listening, and as well as
    volunteering with local charities to hand out aid.</p>
  <p>This article is therefore divided into two parts: a section on the
    time-line, an attempt to reconstruct what happened in 2015 in a more
    objective fashion and a subjective, anecdotal account based on my personal
    on-hand experience.</p>
  <p>This is not a policy critique, nor a manifesto. My goal is simply to frame
    the 2015 migration crisis - a crisis for Europe, and equally for those
    displaced.</p>
  <p><strong>For the sake of clarity: </strong>l am not an advocate of open
    borders. Stability is often under­ valued, as is the reality that every
    society has limits to how far and how fast it can integrate newcomers. What
    those limits are, and how they change, remains a complex and necessary
    fertile ground for debate</p>
  <p><strong>Background and Timeline</strong>

    <span class="caption">Major events during the 2015 European migration crisis</span>

  </p>
  <p></p>
  <p>The year 2015 became a perfect storm of collapsing states. The 2011 Arab
    Spring had triggered turmoil across the Middle East and North Africa, and
    nowhere was the fallout more harrowing than Syria, where a civil war of
    barrel bombs and proxy militias left entire cities in ruins. Afghanistan,
    bruised by decades of occupation and insurgency, continued to have an
    uncertain future. </p>
  <p>Feeding into that chaos were other flashpoints: ISIS overrunning swathes of
    Iraq and Syria, Libya splintering into militias that turned its coastline
    into a base for people smugglers. Neighbouring countries such as Turkey,
    Lebanon, and Jordan sheltered millions but were themselves being
    destabilised by the strain. When Germany signalled in mid-2015 that Syrians
    would not be returned under the Dublin rules, the “Balkan Route” -stretching
    from the Greek Islands through Macedonia, Serbia, and Hungary, Austria then
    Germany- crystallised overnight. What began as a trickle of families
    gathered momentum: refugees fleeing war, Afghans fleeing uncertainty,
    Pakistani job-seekers chasing EU wages, all funnelled toward a Europe that
    was completely unprepared. </p>
  <h2>The Numbers</h2>

        20% were refugees. The immigration wave from Ukraine in 2022 wa8
        substantially larger. Despite not being considered under asylum protections
        the European commission has given Ukrainians <em>temporary protection for
          people </em>until 2027. Numbers collated from Eurostat's public datasets</span>

  <h2>The Aftermath</h2>
  <p>By the end of 2016 the EU still had more than <em>1.1 million </em>asylum
    cases awaiting a final decision-double the backlog recorded two years
    earlier. National offices were overwhelmed, with some drafting retired civil
    servants or rapidly training new caseworkers. The European Asylum Support
    Office described the surge as "the primary indicator of pressure on national
    asylum systems."<sup>1</sup></p>
  <p>Human-rights groups warned that once autumn turned to sleet, the crisis
    would "flip from logistics to triage." In November 2015, Medecius Sans
    Froutieres and UN agencies began issuing winter kits as hypothermia and
    pneumonia cases spiked. Sub-zero snaps over the following winter killed
    dozens of vulnerable people, including migrants, across central and
    southeastern Europe.<sup>2</sup></p>
  <p>Political scientists paint a two layer picture. At the municipal level in
    western Germany, towns that accommodated more asylum seekers after 2015 did
    register a statistically significant uptick in AfD votes. Yet the party's
    true strongholds lie in the eastern Länder (regions of Germany /states),
    which host fewer refugees per capita but exhibit stronger feelings of
    cultural and economic threat. This inverse, <em>absence-breeds-anxiety
    </em>pattern helps explain why, by early 2024, Alternative für Deutschland
    (AfD) was polling above 20 percent nationwide­-surpassing 30 percent in
    parts of Saxony and Thuringia-even though those regions saw only modest
    refugee inflows. Analysts still trace the party's rise to the symbolic shock
    of 2015-16, amplified by post-unification grievances and economic
    stagnation.<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p>In the case of Germany, recent microsimulations using SOEP data show that
    first-generation migrants from 2015 now have a positive fiscal impact. Once
    age structure and indirect taxes are included, their net contributions
    exceed those of natives. Three-quarters of working-age Syrians and Afghans
    were in employment or vocational training by 2023.<sup>4</sup></p>
  <p>Roughly 63% of refugees are now in work, but language barriers, credential
    mismatches, and childcare gaps still hamper full integration-particularly
    for women, whose employment rate remains low. Public opinion surveys also
    reflect continued anxiety about cultural fit and national
    identity.<sup>5</sup></p>

  <h2>My Experience</h2>
  <h3>Arriving in Belgrade, Serbia</h3>
  <p>It was a city I knew well by this point with this my third two-wheeled
    adventure in the region. With my housemate from Germany, and a few Serbian
    friends; Belgrade was the perfect place to meet and celebrate my birthday.
  </p>
  <p>With a day left to get to the city I<em> </em>had managed to descend from
    the mountains along the Montenegrin border, arriving by sunset in a village
    whose occupants rather fortunately were keen to stuff me with their
    delightful food. Harvest season was in full swing. The house I stayed at was
    in the midst of a mass sweet pepper roasting session; many of which were
    destined for jars, hoarded away for the winter months.</p>
  <p>That scent of roasted sweet pepper is a hallmark of the region; and the
    closing days of the summer.</p>
  <div class="image-container">

    <span class="caption">Not far from the Serbian border, my bike packed with my guitar and camping
      equipment.</span>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p>Stuffed like a Christmas turkey; my final leg to Belgrade was a cumbersome
    affair. Being overfed and sleepless does little for one's cadence. I was
    pushing the bounds of time- also known as being late- and decided it best to
    find a hostel and not bother my host with a midnight knock.</p>
  <p>Awaking in the hostel and going to the kitchen l<em> </em>was taken aback.
    Many of the other residents looked like hardened backpackers. This point
    amused the owner of the hostel, "They're refugees" she clarified.
    Unbeknownst to me the stream of refugees through the Balkans had steadily
    increased. Having spent the best part of the month prior on the road l<em>
    </em>was almost entirely detached from the news.</p>
  <h3>Refugee camp in the centre of Belgrade</h3>
  <p>The central park in Belgrade was entirely covered with tents by the time of
    my arrival in late August. Children played football alongside trucks filled
    with aid from various aid agencies. There was so little space that the
    central train station became a makeshift shelter with the authorities
    allowing people to sleep overnight; then ushering them out in the morning to
    make way for the commuters onto the trains.</p>
  <div class="image-container">

    <span class="caption">A moment of quiet allowed for a time of reflection, often bringing to the
      fore the sense of uncertainty. <em>taken by T. Ullmann</em></span>
  </div>
  <p></p>
  <p></p>
  <p>For all the hectic nature of the situation I only witnessed cordiality on
    the part of the authorities.</p>
  <p>Serbia had given transit visas to the migrants and was one of the
    friendlier countries. They had already heard what was ahead in the next
    country, Hungary. Police were far more aggressive, often putting migrants in
    makeshift camps, mocked, as well as claims of rape by the guards. Knowing
    what was to come; and the approximate 600km that many of them had walked,
    Belgrade became a place of rest and solace before the next leg of their
    journey.</p>
  <p>This gave me an opportunity to get to know people over a number of days.
    Mostly they were unsure as to which country they would end up in; even
    asking me for my advice as to where to go. Information was changing daily;
    opportunities would appear, then would pass.</p>
  <p>The demographic of the camp tended to be young; and mostly male, that
    didn't exclude the elderly in wheel chairs, and a host of children. The
    majority of which seemed often oblivious to the uncertainty; playing the
    rain and playing football. This was helped by the aid agencies recognising
    that the migrants needed more than just food and water and provided
    instruments and sound systems that lead to multiple impromptu parties.
    Authorities would restrict how late the music could be played but were
    generally accepting. This often lead to a positive mood in the camp.</p>

      as space was made in the morning for commuters. You would also find
      migrants, looking to see if they could get tickets though the railways were
      apprehensive, Hungary had begun to check the trains by this point making it
      difficult to travel northwards. <em>taken by T. Ullman. </em></span>

  <h3>Some example backgrounds</h3>
  <p>One of the first people I sat with and interviewed was a man I got to know
    in the hostel, Muthanna. Highly educated, Mutharma was keen to talk in his
    impeccable English. He explained to me how he had become suspicious to the
    Assad regime, leading to interrogation, then torture. This wouldn't be the
    last time l<strong> </strong>would hear of these methods. Firstly, given he
    was a religious man, they would burn the quran in front of him as a means of
    insult. Then came the physical torture. A favourite of the Assad regime was
    to slowly pull the toe nails out of their feet.</p>
  <p>Another man was Emad. He was travelling with his friend Waleed and a family
    he was friends with. After a storm battered the camp I had invited them to
    stay at the apartment l<strong> </strong>was living in. Emad was homosexual
    and had faced discrimination.</p>
  <p>There were various families l<strong> </strong>got to know, nearly every
    one fragmented in one way or another. Unaccompanied children were relatively
    common. Jokanda and her sister were travelling alone. They were Kurds from
    northern Syria. At the time she was only 16.</p>
  <p>At one point l<strong> </strong>thought l had met a man from Liverpool
    given a stark scouse accent. He explained to me how he had indeed lived in
    the north of England for ten years before being deported back to Afghanistan
    when the new Tory government of the 2010s deemed Afghanistan safe enough to
    return to. He had had heart issues and couldn't receive the proper treatment
    in Afghanistan, not to mention feeling more at home in Europe.</p>
  <p>There are many other examples, including cricket loving Pakistanis trying
    their chance or other tragic stories like Muthana'ti</p>
  <h3>What happened to those I kept contact with from Belgrade</h3>
  <ul>
    <li>Muthanna went on to live in Norway: in a small village, and went on to
      have a son. Despite taking time to settle in he seems quite happy among
      the picturesque Norwegian nature.</li>
    <li>Emad remains in Berlin, along with Waleed who opened a brewery.</li>
    <li> Jokanda was reunited with her family, including her parents and 7
      siblings. The eldest of her siblings had stayed on in Syria to finish her
      medicine degree and is now a doctor in Germany. Jokanda is currently
      studying at university.</li>
    <li>Another friend Muhammad , works in business in Sweden.</li>
  </ul>

      were separated in the Netherlands and put in two different families. l never
