  <p><em>“If a leader doesn’t change the rules, he can’t fix the system.”</em> —
    Nayib Bukele, 2018</p>
  <p>There is nothing new about a young man with ambition, or even a rich one
    who wants to "give back." What is rare, and far more dangerous, is a man who
    learns early that affection can be bought, loyalty manufactured, and truth
    made elastic. Before Nayib Bukele ever draped himself in presidential
    sashes, he was already rehearsing power. Just not the kind you get from
    votes. The kind you get from controlling the story.</p>
  <p>His rise wasn’t meteoric. It was engineered. And the illusion was not just
    that he represented something different, but that he believed in anything at
    all.</p>
  <h3><a id="_673e7zbnfg7u"></a><strong>The Prince of Nuevo Cuscatlán</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Born in 1981, Nayib Bukele entered the world on the edge of a nation
    ripping itself apart. El Salvador’s civil war was just beginning, and while
    tens of thousands would die over the next decade, Bukele’s childhood was
    sheltered from the bloodshed. His father, Armando Bukele Kattán, was a
    businessman, imam, and polymath who built a fortune through media,
    advertising, and printing ventures. The Bukeles were not merely well-off;
    they were part of the country’s rarefied elite. Above the common people –
    Cosmopolitan, connected, and comfortably above the fray.</p>
  <p>That distance from violence may explain part of Nayib’s political
    detachment. He didn’t grow up with the ideological scars that defined the
    older generation. No allegiance to the guerrilla struggle or military
    counterinsurgency. His upbringing was not marked by factionalism, but by
    marketing. He learned not how to fight for causes, but how to sell them. His
    first steps into professional life weren’t as a community organizer or
    political theorist. He was a college dropout who turned his attention to
    branding. It’s there where the true foundation of Bukele’s politics was
    laid.</p>
  <p>In 2006, Bukele took over as director of Obermet S.A. de C.V., an
    advertising and communications firm founded by his father. Under Nayib’s
    leadership, the company pivoted from basic print media into sleek,
    full-service brand strategy. Obermet’s clients included major companies in
    energy, finance, and telecommunications, but more significantly, it became a
    quiet fixture in Salvadoran political messaging. When the FMLN sought to
    modernize its image ahead of the 2009 presidential campaign, they turned to
    Obermet. Bukele, then in his late twenties, helped craft the image of
    Mauricio Funes — a former CNN journalist turned candidate — as a man of the
    people.</p>
  <p>Obermet produced ads that were emotive, high contrast, and focused more on
    identity than substance. Bukele didn’t write policy. He designed feelings.
    He understood early that Salvadorans, who were disillusioned by decades of
    corruption and violence, weren’t looking for ideology. They were looking for
    someone to believe in. His job was to create that belief, whether or not it
    was true. He was, in the purest sense, an architect of illusion.</p>
  <p>This period taught him more than any political apprenticeship could. He
    learned the anatomy of public perception. He learned how to flatten complex
    issues into digestible slogans, how to manipulate color and light to shape
    emotional response, how to bury criticism in noise, and how to use emerging
    platforms like Facebook and Twitter to bypass media gatekeepers altogether.
    Obermet wasn’t just his business. It was his laboratory.</p>
  <p>It also made him cynical. Branding teaches that everything is flexible.
    Names, values, loyalties, all fair game, so long as the narrative works.
    Bukele saw firsthand how easily Salvadoran politicians could be rebranded,
    how the same hands that waved revolutionary flags in the ’90s could now
    shake those of businessmen and oligarchs, so long as the messaging matched
    the moment. This convinced him that ideology was performative, and that
    success didn’t require belief, only consistency in image.</p>
  <p>So when he launched his own political career as mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán in
    2012, he brought with him the tools of the trade. Campaign posters looked
    like Apple product launches. Videos were tightly edited, background music
    swelled emotionally, and every speech was choreographed to feel spontaneous.
    His social media presence wasn’t just strong; it was surgical. Followers
    received a carefully maintained illusion of access, humor, and relatability.
    He wasn’t selling policies. He was selling a personality.</p>
  <p>And Nuevo Cuscatlán, a small suburb of fewer than 10,000 residents,
    provided the perfect test market. Here, his background in ad psychology and
    image control gave him an overwhelming advantage. He promised transparency,
    progress, and a break from traditional politics. With the town being so
    small, the spectacle itself could substitute for substance. Few cared
    whether the reforms were deep. They looked different, and that was enough.
  </p>
  <p>Bukele had found his method: emotional storytelling, weaponized aesthetics,
    and the erasure of ideology in favor of identity. Politics, to him, was not
    a calling. It was a product. And like any good ad man, he would spend the
    rest of his career making sure people kept buying it.</p>
  <h3><a id="_khytq5bex7jk"></a><strong>Scholarships for the Faithful</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>When Nayib Bukele was elected mayor of Nuevo Cuscatlán in 2012, it was not
    a major political victory. It was a strategic rehearsal. The town, with a
    population of fewer than 10,000 at the time, sits just outside San
    Salvador’s urban sprawl, quiet, small, and easy to control. For a man
    without governing experience but with a background in advertising, it
    offered a blank slate. Not to test policy, but to craft narrative. Bukele’s
    time as mayor was not a political awakening. It was a branding exercise.</p>
  <p>One of the more famous products of this phase was his scholarship program.
    Launched early in his term, the initiative covered tuition and expenses for
    low-income students to attend university. The program was, on the surface,
    progressive and deeply humanistic: a young mayor lifting the poor through
    education. He made sure the cameras were there when families received the
    news. Testimonials followed. Social media was flooded with smiling students
    and grateful parents, all thanking one man. Not the government. Nayib.</p>
  <p>But as with much in Bukele’s career, the gesture was louder than the
    substance. The scholarship program was limited in scale and scope,
    benefiting fewer than 100 students in a municipality with thousands living
    under the poverty line. It lacked oversight, formal evaluation, or
    integration with national education policy. It was disconnected from
    structural improvements. There was no investment in public schools, no
    teacher training, no curriculum reform. This hasn’t changed, even with
    Bukele’s complete control over the political system. Education wasn’t being
    transformed. The message was.</p>

  <p></p>
  <p>Bukele’s philanthropy wasn’t systemic. It was personal, and that was the
    point. The mayor's office was turned into a kind of patronage machine.
    Residents began to associate access to services with loyalty to the figure
    of Bukele himself, rather than with institutions or civic processes. He had
    no party machinery to rely on and didn’t need one. What he created instead
    was a form of political dependence. Gratitude became political currency.
    Visibility became proof of virtue.</p>
  <p>This approach echoed familiar tactics from Latin American strongmen
    throughout history, but it was especially reminiscent of the methods used by
    Pablo Escobar in Colombia. Escobar, the infamous drug lord, also paid for
    scholarships, built soccer fields, funded housing projects, all with the
    explicit aim of manufacturing goodwill among the poor. He didn’t need to
    change the system. He just needed to make people believe he was their only
    hope. Bukele, while not a criminal, operated on a strikingly similar logic.
    He didn’t reform the state; he replaced it with his image.</p>
  <p>Other policies during his mayoral term followed this same template:
    symbolic, isolated, and designed for maximum visual impact. He planted trees
    and opened a small library—photographed, of course, in high definition. He
    boasted about modernizing the town with LED lighting and surveillance
    cameras, signaling an interest in “smart city” aesthetics that would later
    metastasize into full-blown digital authoritarianism. Meanwhile, critics
    noted that public works tended to benefit specific neighborhoods tied to his
    support base, while others languished.</p>
  <p>Despite projecting an image of youthful transparency, Bukele governed Nuevo
    Cuscatlán with tight control. Public records were sparse, budgets were often
    opaque, and his relationship with the city council was marked by
    unilateralism. He rarely engaged in debate or consensus-building; instead,
    decisions were announced through social media as if they had already
    happened. His administration wasn’t participatory. It was performative. He
    didn’t practice politics. He curated it.</p>
  <p>All of this helped develop the most important narrative in his eventual
    national rise: Bukele as the benevolent outsider, the good king who delivers
    when the republic fails. But behind the carefully chosen hashtags and photo
    ops, the foundation was already being laid for a political model that
    substituted loyalty for law and spectacle for policy. Nuevo Cuscatlán was
    not a success story in governance. It was a proof-of-concept for control.
  </p>
  <p>It worked. By the end of his term, Bukele had a cultlike following in the
    town, with many residents openly declaring they would support him no matter
    what office he sought next. That loyalty had nothing to do with ideology or
    party. It was personal, emotional, and uncritical. And it was entirely by
    design.</p>
  <h3><a id="_7bvh0vmm5b1b"></a><strong>The Left That Never Held Him</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Nayib Bukele often speaks as if he emerged from nothing. No ideology, no
    party, no past. But this is not quite true. His rise was incubated by the
    Salvadoran left. It was the FMLN. Born from the guerrilla movements of the
    civil war that gave him his first mayoral post and platform. They handed him
    a flag, a voter base, and a lineage of struggle to drape around himself. And
    in return, he gave them what he gives most alliances: a smile, a speech, and
    eventually, a knife.</p>
  <p>The FMLN’s decision to back Bukele in 2012 was more desperation than
    inspiration. After years of internal fracturing, generational fatigue, and
    the political compromises of governance, the party had lost its
    revolutionary glow. It needed a facelift. Bukele was young, wealthy,
    photogenic, and media-savvy. He was an opportunity. He could attract voters
    the old guard never could. What they didn’t realize was that he wasn’t
    trying to reform the party from within. Bukele was borrowing it, briefly, to
    enter the room. Then he would burn it behind him.</p>
  <p>From the start, his relationship with the FMLN was more parasitic than
    principled. He rarely participated in internal meetings, ignored party
    discipline, and openly criticized leadership while still wearing the party’s
    colors. His campaigns were personalist, not ideological. His face dwarfed
    the FMLN logo on posters. His social media presence focused almost
    exclusively on himself. In a movement that once prided itself on collective
    struggle, Bukele made it all about one man. And he sold the narrative
    brilliantly.</p>
  <p>The left, too fractured and nostalgic to recognize the threat, let it
    happen. They tolerated his transgressions in the name of electability. But
    Bukele wasn’t building a bridge for the FMLN to the next generation, he was
    building an exit for himself. In 2017, the party finally expelled him after
    he insulted a city councilwoman and repeatedly violated internal codes.
    Bukele, true to form, painted himself as a victim. He claimed the party had
    abandoned its values. In reality, he had never held them.</p>
  <p>His expulsion was not a moment of political rebirth. It was a moment of
    political liberation. Without the burden of ideology or party hierarchy,
    Bukele was free to recast himself entirely. He declared himself the only
    “real” anti-corruption candidate, launched <em>Nuevas Ideas</em>, and began
    railing against the very leftist movement that had elevated him. His
    language morphed from social justice to “cleaning house,” from class
    struggle to populist rage. The revolution was rebranded, hollowed out, and
    sold back to the public with better lighting.</p>
  <p>His betrayal of the left was not ideological, it was aesthetic. Bukele
    understood that in a country exhausted by polarization, ideology was a
    liability. People didn’t want theory; they wanted action, or at least the
    appearance of it. They wanted someone who looked like he had answers. So
    Bukele gave them performance: jackets instead of suits, iPads instead of
    briefings, tweets instead of press conferences. And in doing so, he made
    both left and right obsolete.</p>
  <p>But the left was the first to collapse. It had spent years in power
    compromising with neoliberal policy, failing to hold its own accountable,
    and losing the moral clarity that had once made it a symbol of resistance.
    When Bukele arrived, it saw in him not a threat, but a chance. That mistake
    cost them everything. His movement cannibalized the very voters the FMLN
    once mobilized, the young, urban, disillusioned, and poor. And it did so by
    offering not ideology, but vengeance.</p>
  <p>He never needed to beat the left in debate. He only needed to wear its face
    long enough to discredit it. What remains now of El Salvador’s left is a
    husk. Distrusted, scattered, they are unable to reclaim the narrative.
    Bukele stole its language, turned its grievances into his slogans, and then
    used his power to erase the memory of what that movement once stood for.</p>
  <p>The tragedy is not just that Bukele abandoned the left. It’s that the left,
    in its desperation, handed him the keys.</p>
  <h3><a id="_2vcert16x4xs"></a><strong>A New Party for a New Man</strong></h3>
  <p>When Nayib Bukele launched <em>Nuevas Ideas</em> in 2018, he was not
    offering a political alternative. He was offering an exorcism. The party (if
    one can even call it that) did not emerge from a collective platform,
    grassroots pressure, or ideological necessity. It emerged from a single
    premise: that all existing parties were irredeemably corrupt, and only
    Bukele could fix them. He was no longer merely the candidate. He was now the
    movement.</p>
  <p>The name itself, “<em>New Ideas</em>”, was vague by design. It promised
    transformation without specifying direction. Was it left? Right? Reformist?
    Revolutionary? It didn’t matter. In a country where faith in political
    institutions had collapsed, ambiguity was a feature, not a bug. Bukele’s
    message was simple: trust me, not the system. And people did. Within months,
    <em>Nuevas Ideas</em> gathered over 200,000 signatures, an unprecedented
    surge in a nation known for apathy. But what those supporters signed onto
    wasn’t a platform. It was a personality cult with a blue checkmark.</p>
  <p>This was the moment Bukele transcended traditional politics. He had already
    worn the left like a mask and abandoned it. Now he would transcend the party
    system itself. He told supporters that <em>Nuevas Ideas</em> would be a
    citizen-led movement, untainted by ideology. He branded himself as a
    post-political savior, the rare leader unowned by history. But that
    narrative collapsed almost immediately when, due to bureaucratic timing,
    <em>Nuevas Ideas</em> couldn’t register in time for the 2019 elections.
    Bukele needed a party. Fast.</p>
  <p>He found one in GANA, the Grand Alliance for National Unity, is a
    center-right party founded by defectors from ARENA, the very party once
    associated with death squads, corporate impunity, and military dictatorship.
    It was, in many ways, the embodiment of everything Bukele claimed to oppose.
    And yet, with no hesitation, he accepted their platform as a temporary host.
    Once again, principle was irrelevant. The move wasn’t ideological. It was
    parasitic.</p>
  <p>GANA, desperate for relevance, handed Bukele the nomination without a
    primary. In doing so, they ceased to be a party and became a shell, a legal
    vehicle for a man who had no use for their history or their beliefs. With
    their history being one of dictators and oppression, however, strongman
    Bukele respects their history by disrespecting it, and taking it for
    himself. </p>
  <p> The irony was staggering: Bukele had gone from leftist reformer to
    right-wing opportunist in a matter of months. But his followers didn’t
    flinch. He told them it was just a technicality. The end justifies the
    means. The same narrative Escobar once used when running for office as an
    “independent reformer” while bankrolling old guard politicians.</p>
  <p>With GANA’s ballot line and <em>Nuevas Ideas</em>’ mythos, Bukele ran—and
    won. In doing so, he proved something more dangerous than the power of
    populism. He proved that in a country exhausted by betrayal, identity could
    be erased and rewritten at will. That truth didn’t matter if it came with
    good lighting. That if you destroyed enough bridges behind you, people would
    forget there was ever a path to begin with.</p>
  <div class="image-container">
    <img src="images/image2.png" alt="Image 2" />
    <span class="caption"></span>
  </div>
  <p><em>Nuevas Ideas</em> soon absorbed the state like fog rolling in. It
    functioned less like a party and more like an app; slick, efficient,
    centralized. Internal democracy was nonexistent. Dissenters were purged,
    candidates were handpicked, and Bukele’s family and inner circle
    consolidated control behind the scenes. The party's candidates were mostly
    unknowns, loyalists, influencers, or bureaucrats selected for obedience over
    vision. Once in the Assembly, they passed laws like users accepting terms of
    service: instantly, without question.</p>
  <p>The myth of political independence became a mask for absolute control.
    Bukele wasn’t building a new democracy. He was building a new loyalty
    machine. The party was not a platform. It was a spotlight. It didn’t carry a
    worldview. It carried a man. Every function, every speech, every campaign
    image revolved around his personal mythology: the president in a backwards
    cap, the rebel in the palace, the savior with no past.</p>
  <p>And like every strongman before him, Bukele claimed that he had been forced
    to break the rules because the rules were broken. That <em>Nuevas Ideas</em>
    was the only possible future for a country at war with its past. That
    ideology is obsolete, and that the people should vote not for policies, but
    for purity.</p>
  <p>It worked. But the implications are chilling. A nation desperate for change
    handed its institutions to a man who promised everything and defined
    nothing. A party that claimed to be new became the oldest trick in the
    authoritarian playbook: the illusion of choice under the shadow of one man’s
    design.</p>
  <h3><a id="_4panlro9t730"></a><strong>Politics as Performance</strong></h3>
  <p>By the time Nayib Bukele stepped into the presidential palace in 2019, it
    was no longer clear whether he was a politician or an actor playing one. His
    campaign had never really been about policy, nor even about ideology, it was
    about mood. Aesthetics. Storytelling. He wasn’t elected to govern; he was
    elected to perform. And the stage had been set perfectly.</p>
  <p>Bukele understood early on that Salvadoran politics was not a contest of
    plans, but of narratives. In a country where both the left and right had
    burned through their moral capital; embroiled in scandals, corruption, and
    hypocrisy, truth had become secondary to the feeling of truth. And Bukele,
    with a decade in advertising and a career spent controlling optics, knew
    exactly how to produce that feeling.</p>
  <p>His greatest political skill isn’t rhetoric, it’s editing. He curated his
    persona the way one curates a brand: the backwards snapback, the leather
    jacket, the staged visits to crime-ridden neighborhoods flanked by cameras
    and drones. His speeches were short, often streamed directly on Facebook
    Live, designed less to inform and more to be shared. Even his silences were
    strategic. He rarely submitted to interviews, preferring instead to speak
    unfiltered to the public through his tightly managed social media accounts;
    where criticism was often deleted, blocked, or drowned under waves of fan
    replies. He didn’t need journalists. He had followers.</p>
  <p>This was not democracy in any meaningful sense. It was image management.
    And Bukele was its central product.</p>
  <p>From his time as mayor, he treated public office as a stage set. He
    announced infrastructure projects with cinematographic flair and often
    without legislative approval. He installed LED light shows in San Salvador,
    declared “smart city” initiatives, and posed with garbage trucks like a
    campaign model. In Nuevo Cuscatlán, his first mayorship, his administration
    emphasized beautification, public art, and selective social spending like
    student scholarships. Programs that looked good on camera and earned
    applause, even as more structural reforms remained elusive.</p>
  <p>And just like the narco barons who handed out housing in exchange for
    silence, Bukele's generosity came with strings: loyalty, optics, and erasure
    of dissent. His projects were not built for permanence; they were built for
    applause. When policy clashed with spectacle, spectacle always won.</p>
  <p>In this new model of governance, traditional markers of credibility:
    Experience, institutional backing, and ideological consistency, no longer
    mattered. Bukele’s entire rise was predicated on rejecting those values. He
    did not care to debate his opponents; he discredited them. He did not build
    coalitions; he overwhelmed them. And rather than present a coherent agenda,
    he offered a singular, intoxicating message: <em>trust me</em>.</p>
  <p>What followed was not a campaign, but a movement of projection. Supporters
    saw in him whatever they wanted to see: a rebel, a technocrat, a
    nationalist, a reformer, a messiah. He never contradicted them. Instead, he
    floated above the contradictions. A man of the left who ran with the right.
    A critic of caudillismo who tweeted like a generalissimo. An anti-corruption
    crusader who never explained his own opaque financing. Each paradox became
    part of the myth. Bukele was the mirror, not the image.</p>
  <p>And so, on June 1, 2019, as he stood with his trademark smirk and took the
    presidential oath, there was no doubt whose victory it was. Not the
    people’s, not <em>Nuevas Ideas’</em>, but his alone. He had maneuvered
    through three parties, discarded ideology like old clothes, and emerged with
    near-total control of the national narrative. He had entered office not as
    the leader of a republic, but as the protagonist of a story only he could
    write and only he was allowed to end.</p>
  <p>What would come next could not be predicted by party platforms or policy
    papers. Bukele had left all that behind. What came next would be something
    else entirely.</p>
