  <p> Once upon a time, Elon nodded along to the idea that net taxpayers should
    get a check—a little kickback for all the money DOGE supposedly saved
    America. And people actually thought that was real. I never took this
    seriously and thought it was weird when I would search for DOGE information
    and always saw multiple articles updating or inquiring about these “DOGE”
    checks, but didn’t think much of it. I wasn’t concerned with imaginary
    things when real damage was being done, but apparently, a lot of other
    people were very concerned about it. So much so that in February, there were
    more<a
      href="https://trends.google.com/trends/explore?geo=US&amp;q=doge%20checks,tax%20refunds&amp;hl=en">
      Google searches for DOGE checks</a> than there were for actual tax
    refunds.</p>
  <p> For the folks that live in the real world, when Elon was proclaiming he
    could easily cut $2 trillion from the government budget, a <a
      href="https://x.com/j_fishback/status/1891933120313663493">CEO named James
      Fishback</a> did some quick math and said that sending 20% of those
    savings back to “net taxpaying households” would amount to a $5k DOGE
    Dividend check. Per his logic, it wouldn’t go to the ‘poors’, it would go to
    the people who are taxpayers, people who are supposedly responsible with
    their money, so they would either save it or pay down debt. Something tells
    me that it was the people that weren’t going to get this check who were
    putting in those google searches.</p>
  <p>So why is this even a thing? The same people who think the government is
    useless are now obsessing over a payout from it. </p>
  <p>Well, plenty of folks have noticed the attention this has gotten and if you
    are part of the ‘right’ email lists, you will find some politicians actively
    using it to fundraise. Many letters have gone out to constituents claiming
    these checks are at risk from evil Dems. Send money to their campaign and
    they will make sure the IRS is gutted and federal employees become society’s
    pariahs, all for a cool $5K. <a href="https://dcinbox.com/#">Help yourself
      to a database</a> of all newsletters sent by a member of Congress.</p>

  </div>
  <p>Except even the most superficial look at this promise will show that these
    numbers don’t add up: </p>
  <ul>
    <li>Elon said DOGE would save $2T, so 20% of that to taxpayers would be $5K
      checks<br /></li>
    <li>But he later said $1T → $2.5K checks<br /></li>
    <li>Actual reported savings per DOGE website = $150B (but even that’s
      sketchy)<br /></li>
    <li>Actual itemized savings on the website are more like $65B…<br /></li>
    <li>Cost of DOGE chaos = $135B</li>
  </ul>
  <p> So, we’re now in the red.</p>
  <p><strong>Turns out, Government is hard</strong></p>
  <p>Why did people think Elon was the guy to bring this home? Elon has this
    reputation of doing amazing things, but really how well does that hold up to
    scrutiny. His government record is not a good one. </p>
  <p>This trend of overpromising has carried on in other Elon/DOGE-ventures.
    They were supposed to find enormous savings when they cut out all the fraud
    at the Social Security Association.Their highly touted anti-fraud tool <a
      href="https://www.nextgov.com/digital-government/2025/05/doge-went-looking-phone-fraud-ssa-and-found-almost-none/405346/">only
      found 2 potential fraudulent claims </a>after reviewing over 100,000. The
    tool did manage to slow down processing by 25%, leaving them with a bit of a
    backlog to make up. </p>
  <p>Social Security is actually a pretty solid program, with an amount of
    overhead that private companies would kill for, but there are other areas
    where some anti-fraud protections would be really impactful. The Government
    Accountability Office released a report that the US loses between $<a
      href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-24-105833">200 and $500 billion
    </a>annually to fraud. This is an area where the government sorely needs
    their processes updated. The massive aid sent in response to the covid
    pandemic was a windfall to bad actors. Anytime there are disasters, the
    government has to balance its desire to get support to people that need it
    with the measures it takes to keep fraudsters from it. There are also
    serious issues with <a
      href="https://www.gao.gov/products/gao-25-107743">Medicare and Medicaid
      payments</a>. These are well-documented problems with ready-made solutions
    and huge potential savings, but instead of tackling that, DOGE has focused
    on ideological boogeymen–imaginary illegal immigrants collecting Social
    Security benefits.</p>
  <p>DOGE is talking a big game about stopping voter fraud, but like the <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/04/13/us/politics/doge-contracts-savings.html">contracts
      they “canceled</a>”, they seem to be getting credit for an assist that
    they didn’t provide. Right wing articles like to cite a case where a <a
      href="https://thefederalist.com/2025/05/02/dhs-doge-work-together-to-track-down-election-fraudsters/?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=The%20plea%20agreement,supervisor%20detected%20fraud.">Russian
      National pleaded guilty</a> to submitting 100 fraudulent voter
    registration applications, but this happened in 2023 and processes already
    set in Florida rejected all of them before a vote was cast. Another commonly
    cited case is of <a
      href="https://www.wptv.com/news/region-s-palm-beach-county/boynton-beach/ukrainian-mother-daughter-from-boynton-beach-accused-of-illegal-voting-in-2024-election#:~:text=They%20said%20in%20this%20case%2C%20the%20state%20determined%20in%20December%20that%20the%20two%20were%20not%20U.S.%20citizens%2C%20and%20then%20sent%20the%20Palm%20Beach%20County%20Supervisor%20of%20Elections%20this%20info.">two
      Ukranian green card holders</a> that registered to vote and voted in the
    2024 election. They claimed they didn’t know they couldn’t, while I can’t
    find evidence that their votes were not counted, the processes in place have
    already determined these women were not citizens and have updated their
    status. Reports have DOGE referring 57 claims of voter fraud to the DOJ, but
    there haven been no updates on the progress, who those people are, or if
    they actually voted.</p>
  <p>Elon left a lot of people with their hand out during the election too.
    While the court cases are still grappling with the questions of whether or
    not Elon’s election efforts were even legal, he definitely owes people
    money. His <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/musks-election-pac-sued-over-alleged-failure-pay-100-petition-signers-2025-05-14/">PAC
      is currently dealing with a lawsuit</a> because he promised to pay people
    $100 for signing a petition supporting the US constitution if those
    registered voters would refer to voters from one of the seven swing states.
    He didn’t pay them. He also promised those voters that they would be
    eligible for a $1 million-a-day giveaway, and he had to admit in <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/legal/judge-weighs-challenge-elon-musks-1-million-voter-giveaway-2024-11-04/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">another
      court case</a> that the people that got that award were pre-selected
    because they were spokespeople for his pro-Trump agenda.</p>
  <p>Elon’s professional track record is dubious as well, particularly regarding
    Tesla. He has been promising Tesla owners an upgrade for<a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/elon-musks-late-unfulfilled-tesla-promises-2025-04-22/">
      full self-driving since 2016</a>. The <a

      Semi which was supposed to go out in 2019</a> has been pushed back to the
    end of 2025, only to be stopped again because of Trump’s tariffs. Lastly the
    most egregious has to be his showing in 2021 of his “robot” that was
    actually just a <a

  <p><strong>The Quiet Cost of Loud Leaders</strong></p>
  <p>To be sure, there are known problems with how the government works, but we
    know what they are because the government actively reviews itself and
    reports on what those problems are. Of course, these reports are boring,
    detailed, and have specific recommendations and metrics to gauge for
    success. This garners no anger and sales no advertisement spots. Trump and
    co. recontextualize this as though it’s just incompetence, change out
    fraudsters with illegal immigrants, and put it on display in the worst
    lighting possible, instead of fixing actual problems. This way, they get to
    focus on their ideological boogeymen. Really, if you compare their track
    record, it completely makes sense that they became buddies. </p>
  <p>In Trump’s first term, he was supposed to build a big beautiful wall (that
    Mexico would pay for), cut taxes, and kill Obamacare. Of course, he only <a
      href="https://www.politico.com/news/2021/01/12/trump-border-wall-partially-built-458255?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=about%2040%20miles%20as%20of%20Dec.%2018%2C%20according%20to%20a%20Customs%20and%20Border%20Protection%20report%20published%20by%20nonpartisan%20Factcheck.org%20%E2%80%94%20is%20newly%20constructed%20wall%20where%20none%20previously%20existed.">built
      40 miles of new wall</a> and the ACA survived. While his tax cuts made it
    through, over <a
      href="https://www.politifact.com/truth-o-meter/promises/trumpometer/">half
      of his campaign promises</a> were broken. Even if you focus on
    immigration, supposedly the area he is most known for, he constantly
    under-performs in actually enforcing the laws effectively. Both<a
      href="https://elpasomatters.org/2025/02/13/gigafact-fact-brief-most-deportations-obama-trump-removals/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">
      Obama</a> and <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/us/trump-set-broaden-arrests-deportation-routes-expand-immigration-crackdown-2025-02-21/?utm_source=chatgpt.com">Biden</a>
    administrations were better at deporting illegal immigrants. Probably the
    most effective thing Trump has done in regards to immigration has been to
    make sure no one wants to come to America at all, but this doesn’t only
    affect immigration,<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/travel/us-summer-travel-trump.html">
      it also affects tourism</a> and significant parts of the economy.</p>
  <p>It seems like the real lesson from this administration, that was very
    evident the first time around, if you actually like Trump’s policies, you
    shouldn’t want Trump or Elon in charge of implementing them. They don’t
    address the problems they find, they inflate them. They are too deep into
    their ideological bubble to recognize failure and too proud to course
    correct. All they’ll leave us with is wreckage, resentment, and bigger
    problems for someone else to clean up.</p>
