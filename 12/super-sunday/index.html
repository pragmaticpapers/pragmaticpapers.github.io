  <p>Super Sunday 2025: </p>
  <p>The Polish, Romanian and Portuguese Elections and what it means for the EU
  </p>
  <p>Thomas R Ullmann </p>
  <p>May 18, 2025 </p>
  <p><strong>Update: early results and reactions </strong></p>
  <p>• Marches planned on 25th May by both the liberal Civic Coalition party as
    well as the radical-right in Poland, prior to the second round. </p>
  <p>• Centre-right party wins, but falls short of majority in Portugal with
    record far-right gains. A concerning shot across the bow. A possible
    coalition with the pro-business Liberal Initiative will still likely fall
    short of a majority. What looks likely is a minority government and the risk
    of political stasis risking yet further support for the far-right in the
    future. </p>
  <p>• Bucharest mayor Dan on course to win Romanian presidency, the pro Europe
    candidate appears to have won convincingly. Last year’s elections had been
    cancelled as a result of likely notable Russian interference. The far-right
    candidate has cast doubt on the current election though with no evidence to
    hand. </p>
  <p><strong>Overview, contests and consequences </strong></p>
  <p>Sunday, <strong>18 May 2025 </strong>has been billed as Europe's <em>Super
      Sunday</em>, with three pivotal ball lots—Portugal’s third snap
    parliamentary election in as many years, Poland’s first-round presidential
    vote, and Romania’s unprecedented rerun presidential run-off—all taking
    place within a single day. The simultaneity of these contests offers a rare,
    synchronised snapshot of political realignments across Europe's north-east,
    south-west and eastern periphery. </p>
  <p>Although the three contests differ in constitutional design and local
    context, they are united by a common set of anxieties: war on the Union’s
    borders, the rising salience of migration, and a sharpened debate about the
    limits of Brussels’s authority. </p>
  <p>This article dissects each election in turn, profiles the principal
    contenders, and maps the broader continental stakes. </p>
  <p>1</p>
  <p><strong>Poland: First Round of the Presidential Election </strong></p>
  <p>The presidency in Poland is not merely ceremonial: the head of state can
    veto legislation and shape foreign and defence policy. For the reform minded
    government of Prime Minister Don ald Tusk, replacing outgoing conservative
    President Andrzej Duda is therefore <em>sine qua non </em>for completing the
    rollback of PiSera institutional changes[1]. The field is fragmented but
    coalesces around four personalities. </p>
  <p><strong>Rafał Trzaskowski (Civic Platform) </strong></p>
  <p>Warsaw’s cosmopolitan mayor campaigns on an unabashedly proEuropean
    platform: deeper integration, liberalised social policy, and a 5 % GDP
    defence target[2]. His technocratic style—some say aloof—recalls Macron’s
    2017 bid, a comparison Trzaskowski himself courts. Critics on the right
    accuse him of elitism and of privileging urban Poland over the “Bclass”
    periphery. </p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>Karol Nawrocki (independent, backed by PiS) </strong></p>
  <p>A 42 year old historian who made his name at the Museum of the Second World
    War, Nawrocki offers continuity with nationalist rhetoric minus PiS’s
    baggage. He promises lower taxes, a partial clawback of the EU’s Green Deal,
    and a harder line on migration and LGBTQ rights. His tenure at the Institute
    of National Remembrance has drawn criticism for selective historiography
    that downplays Polish complicity in wartime atrocities. </p>
  <p><strong>Sławomir Mentzen (Confederation) </strong></p>
  <p>Occupying the hard libertarian-nativist niche, Mentzen is famous for the
    “five no—s”: no gays, no abortions, no Jews, no EU, no taxes[3]. Recent
    polling places him third, yet his incendiary social media persona has
    dragged the debate rightwards. Mentzen’s depiction of Ukrainian refugees as
    “economic freeloaders”[4] has drawn rebuke from Jewish and human rights
    organisations. </p>
  <p><strong>Other figures </strong></p>
  <p>Szymon Hołownia, speaker of the Sejm and founder of <em>Polska 2050</em>,
    presents an ecosocial democratic alternative but remains a longshot. </p>
  <p><strong>Romania: Presidential Run-Off Rerun </strong></p>
  <p>After the annulment of last November’s tainted vote, Romanians return to
    the polls in a binary choice that pundits frame as “mathematician versus
    hooligan”[5]. The presidency </p>
  <p>2</p>
  <p>wields outsized influence over foreign and security policy in a NATO
    frontline state, with Romania bordering Ukraine.</p>

    <span class="caption">George Simion (AUR)</span>
  </div>
  </p>
  <p>Simion’s ultra nationalist Alliance for the Union of Romanians (AUR) blends
    Trumpist performativity with Orthodox moralism. He rails against “Brussels
    diktats” and proposes <em>Meloni sation</em>—a metaphor for tearing down EU
    structures. Investigations trace his media amplification to proKremlin
    networks in Romania and Moldova[6]. Critics fear democratic backsliding akin
    to Hungary should he prevail. </p>
  <p><strong>Nicuşor Dan (Independent) </strong></p>
  <p>An MIT trained mathematician and Bucharest mayor, Dan entered politics
    through anti corruption activism. Praised for evidence-based governance, he
    nonetheless faces scepticism from rural voters who view him as detached from
    everyday hardships. Dan brands the election a referendum on Romania’s
    Western alignment. </p>
  <p><strong>Portugal: Third Snap Legislative Election </strong></p>
  <p>Portugal’s semi proportional system all but guarantees coalition
    bargaining. A year after a razorthin AD minority was toppled in a confidence
    vote over a family-linked consultancy, the same protagonists square off
    again[8]. </p>
  <p><strong>Democratic Alliance (AD)—Luís Montenegro </strong></p>
  <p>Montenegro positions himself as a conservative moderniser: tax relief,
    tighter migration controls, and housing supply reforms. The opposition
    alleges conflicts of interest surrounding <em>Spinumviva</em>, a data
    protection firm formerly under his family[7]. </p>
  <p><strong>Socialist Party (PS)—Pedro Nuno Santos </strong></p>
  <p>Santos seeks to reconsolidate the centre-left after António Costa’s 2023
    resignation amid an unproven influence-peddling probe. His eco-Keynesian
    programme emphasises public investment and rent caps but struggles against
    voter fatigue. </p>
  <p><strong>Chega—André Ventura </strong></p>
  <p>Ventura’s farright Chega maintains third place with populist calls for
    chemical castration of rapists and mass deportations of irregular migrants.
    Internal scandals—from expense-fund abuse to allegations of racist hate
    speech[7]—have stalled earlier momentum. </p>
  <p>3</p>
  <p><strong>Smaller Parties </strong></p>
  <p>The Liberal Initiative (IL), Livre, the Communists, and Left Bloc each
    target niche electorates, shaping post election arithmetic rather than vying
    for the premiership. </p>
  <p><strong>What does this mean for Europe as a whole? </strong></p>
  <p>Sunday’s verdicts will determine whether 2025 becomes another punctuation
    mark in Eu rope’s drift toward ideological polarisation or the start of a
    counter-reaction that recentres the project on liberal cooperation. </p>
  <p><strong>A Tale of Two Trajectories </strong></p>
  <p>• <strong>Centrist Upswing. </strong>If polling frontrunner Rafał
    Trzaskowski captures the Polish presidency <em>and </em>either Montenegro or
    Santos denies Chega real leverage in Lisbon, the backbone
    Paris-Berlin-Warsaw would be further strengthened. That coalition augmented
    by Madrid and, potentially, a pro EU Prague would control roughly two-thirds
    of the Union's GDP and population. The balance of power inside the European
    Council would tilt toward Macron Style <em>souveraineté européenne</em>:
    joint defence procurement, deeper capital-market union, and a more robust
    migration-burden sharing scheme. Crucially, a liberal Poland would deprive
    Viktor Orbán of his main veto ally, rendering Budapest's obstructionism a
    nuisance rather than an existential threat. </p>
  <p>• <strong>An Island of Illiberalism. </strong>A George Simion win in
    Romania-especially if paired with a strong Chega showing or an unexpected
    runoff surge by Mentzen in Poland-would turn that map on its head. Illiberal
    executives would then govern contiguous territory from the Baltic to the
    Black Sea (Estonia excepted) and from the Carpathians to the Adriatic. Even
    without a blocking minority, that ’island ’ could gum up unanimity files
    Ukraine accession, the 2026 budget top-up, climate border tariffs-by trading
    mutual vetoes. The European Parliament elected in June 2024 already hosts
    the largest hard right caucus in its history; three fresh national victories
    would normalise that posture at the Council level. </p>
  <p><strong>Net Direction: More or Less Extreme? </strong></p>
  <p>Empirically, support for far-right lists across the EU plateaued at about
    22% of the vote in 2024, down slightly from its 2019 peak. Yet the
    dispersion is widening: extremes consolidate power where governance failures
    and cultural insecurity intersect, while moderates prove resilient where
    welfare states buffered the energy-price shock. In that sense Europe is
    <em>both </em>more and less radical: the mean is drifting mildly inward, but
    the tails are fattening. </p>
  <p>Super Sunday thus functions as a tipping-point referendum on which vector
    dominates the 2025-2029 cycle. A liberal night would entrench a multi-speed
    but fundamentally integrationist Union; a nationalist sweep would
    institutionalise veto politics and push Brussels into defensive minimalism.
    The outcome will not decide whether Europeans become more extreme in
    absolute terms, but rather whether the <em>centres of decision-making
    </em>migrate toward the edges or stay anchored in a pro-European middle.</p>
