  <p><strong>Bridging the Channel: The UK’s Strategic Pivot Back to
      Europe</strong></p>
  <p>On May 19th, the UK government will meet with EU leaders in the first
    summit since Brexit. The meeting is the first of what is to be an annual
    bilateral summit focused on building a stronger partnership between London
    and Brussels. Once, these meetings would happen around 4 times a year. Since
    Brexit, those meetings were completely halted. </p>
  <p>Now, the Labour government <a
      href="https://researchbriefings.files.parliament.uk/documents/LLN-2024-0035/LLN-2024-0035.pdf">promised
    </a><em>“...an improved and ambitious relationship with our</em></p>
  <p><em>European partners”. </em>The UK and EU have been cooperating more
    closely in recent years, with things such as <a
      href="https://pragmaticpapers.github.io/09/coalition-of-the-willing/"><em>The
        Coalition of the Willing</em></a>. A new pact would further strength
    these ties, a critical step towards a robust, intertwined, and efficient
    partnership. </p>
  <p>Conservatives, however, have a different view of the summit. They call it a
    <a
      href="https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2025/05/16/starmer-not-to-be-trusted-with-brexit-eu-reset-disaster/">“Surrender
      Summit”</a>, a “Great British Sellout”. Andrew Griffith, the Conservative
    Shadow Business and Trade Secretary <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x395pvvjo">said</a> the UK
    would lose <em>"our freedom to set our own rules"</em>. Richard Tice, Reform
    UK's deputy leader, asked <em>"Why would you want to reset and get closer to
      a patently failing economic model? The EU is struggling even more than we
      are. We should be diverging as fast as we can away from that."</em></p>
  <p>Conservatives are unlikely to ever acknowledge that Brexit was a mistake,
    regardless of its consequences. This presents an opportunity for Keir
    Starmer to demonstrate that, in his own words, "serious pragmatism defeats
    performative politics." While bound by the policy red lines established at
    the beginning of his government’s term, Starmer’s Labour Party must make a
    compelling case to the British public for why a reset in UK–EU relations is
    now more necessary than ever.</p>
  <p>Starmer really has no choice but to capitulate to some of their demands.
    Before Labour was in power, Starmer opposed Brexit vehemently. By the time
    he was in power, the UK was out of the EU, and Starmer figured Labour should
    accept this outcome. Advisers told him that attempts to remove or reduce
    Brexit terms would cost many votes Labour needed to be in power, and he
    listened. He created red lines that he cannot cross even now, including not
    returning to the single market, no customs union membership, and no free
    movement of people. Going back on these would cost Labour key political
    capital, a cost it cannot hope to bear. </p>
  <p>Starmer’s stated objective has never been to reverse Brexit, but to "make
    Brexit work" through a pragmatic approach. Yet even with significant
    concessions aimed at appeasing Conservative critics, those on the right
    remain unsatisfied. Reform UK leader Richard Tice has gone so far as to
    threaten that his party would dismantle any agreements reached with the EU,
    declaring, “If I'm right about our fears, and we win the next general
    election, we will just reverse the lot. The whole lot.” This underscores a
    broader dynamic: the opposition will eagerly accept any compromise Labour
    offers, only to demand more until nothing remains. In such a climate,
    conceding ground for the sake of political optics is futile. Importantly,
    around three-quarters of those who backed Labour in the 2024 election
    previously voted Remain in the Brexit referendum. This suggests the
    political risk of pursuing renewed cooperation with the EU is far smaller
    than it may appear.</p>
  <p>For the meeting to result in meaningful and lasting progress, any agreement
    reached must go beyond symbolic gestures and establish a concrete framework
    for enhanced security cooperation. This includes not only improved
    intelligence sharing and coordinated responses to emerging threats but also
    the development of joint strategies to address issues such as terrorism,
    cybercrime, and geopolitical instability. With Washington signaling a
    decrease in its presence on the continent, strengthening these ties would
    help rebuild trust, bolster mutual resilience, and demonstrate a shared
    commitment to maintaining regional and global security. Starmer laid out key
    points he wishes to make progress on at the summit. These include deeper
    defence cooperation, establishing a clear agreement on EU fishing access to
    UK waters, facilitating youth mobility across the EU, and rejoining key EU
    databases on crime and migration. </p>
  <p><strong>Bridging the Strategic Divide</strong></p>
  <p>In 2020, when then Prime Minister Boris Johnson was negotiating Brexit, a
    Security and Defense partnership was floated. However, Johnson's goal was
    independence from Brussels. As a result, any formal agreement on defence and
    security cooperation was ultimately sidelined, leaving a significant gap in
    UK–EU strategic relations at a time when cross-border threats were becoming
    increasingly complex and interconnected.</p>
  <p>Now, a pact could be within reach. Kaja Kallas, the European Union’s High
    Representative for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, oversaw early
    negotiations at Lancaster House. "Considering what is going on in the world
    […] we need to move forward with this partnership.” <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c20x395pvvjo">She told Telegraph’s
      Damian Grammaticas</a>. Her involvement signals a renewed sense of urgency
    and commitment on the EU side to reestablish strategic ties with the UK.

  <p>Any agreement reached must go beyond vague assurances and political
    rhetoric. If Keir Starmer is committed to prioritizing pragmatism over
    performative politics, as he has claimed, he must confront the core defence
    challenges facing both the UK and the EU. These include addressing
    persistent funding and capability gaps, improving joint deployment and
    military mobility, and streamlining defence production to reduce costly
    duplication across member states. A credible partnership must be built on
    practical solutions, not symbolic gestures. </p>
  <p>Fragmentation in the EU defense sector has been a persistent issue. Member
    states frequently make national defence decisions in isolation, undermining
    overall efficiency and severely limiting interoperability. A renewed
    agreement should prioritise aligning the UK and EU defence industries—not as
    competitors, but as strategic partners. In a climate where the reliability
    of NATO can no longer be taken for granted, European nations must move
    beyond internal competition and commit to deeper collaboration to safeguard
    their collective security.</p>
  <p>For example, the SAFE (Security Action for Europe) programme is being set
    up by the EU to allow nearly 150 billion Euros in loans for new projects. If
    the UK can set up a deal, British defense industries could potentially have
    access to some of this cash. Kevin Craven, chief executive of ADS Group, a
    UK trade association that represents aerospace, defence and security firms
    said estimated that the UK could boost the EU’s defense output by a fifth.
  </p>
  <p>However, opponents say the UK should not care to work so closely on defense
    with the EU. "The cornerstone of our defence is NATO," Alex Burghart, a
    Conservative frontbencher, told the Commons this week. "We know of no reason
    why NATO is insufficient." Richard Tice concurred, saying <em>"We do not
      want to be constrained by a bungling top-down bureaucratic military
      structure. Our defence is guaranteed by NATO."</em></p>
  <p>The Labour government responded by saying the partnership will not
    undermine NATO, but rather complement it. It will stretch beyond defense,
    including things such as infrastructure, energy supplies, and migration.
    Critics of the plan should be met with clear-eyed resolve. Many of them,
    while having championed separation from the EU in the name of sovereignty,
    now cling to NATO dependence, even as its reliability is increasingly in
    question. This inconsistency exposes the need for a more self-reliant and
    cooperative European approach to security. These are the same people who
    wouldn’t lift a finger to bolster their own defences, even if Russian tanks
    were at their doorstep. Their views lack both credibility and conviction,
    and should be treated accordingly.</p>
  <p><strong>Opening Doors, Raising Fences</strong></p>
  <p>A youth mobility deal has sparked interest in recent months, a scheme which
    would allow students under 30 to live and work in each other's countries.
    This would boost research and innovation across Europe. The government said
    there were "no plans" for such a deal for quite a while, but earlier this
    month they flipped, with Labour's Thomas-Symonds saying "A smart, controlled
    youth mobility scheme would of course have benefits for our young people".
    The UK has similar schemes set in place with 13 countries already, including
    Australia, Japan, and India.</p>
  <p>The UK has not joined the EU’s <a
      href="https://erasmus-plus.ec.europa.eu/the-uk-and-erasmus">Erasmus</a>
    program, which funds exchanges in education, sports, and training, but has
    joined its <a
      href="https://ec.europa.eu/commission/presscorner/detail/en/ip_23_6327">Horizon
      Research program</a>. </p>
  <p>This has led to fractures in the EU government. Rachel Reeves, Chancellor
    of the Exchequer, champions it for the economic benefits it would surely
    bring. Yvette Cooper, Secretary of State for the Home Department, has a
    different perspective. She advocates for an <a
      href="https://www.independent.co.uk/voices/yvette-cooper-eu-youth-mobility-freedom-movement-b2739463.html">“one
      in, one out”</a> agenda, keeping her goal of remaining “immigration
    neutral”, while keeping the benefits of youth mobility, and standing ground
    on keeping the youth for a maximum of one year before needing to renew.
    There is expected to be a compromise on this issue on the 19th, but it is
    not certain. </p>
  <p><strong>Fishing for Influence</strong></p>
  <p>After Brexit, British fishermen were not pleased with Boris Johnson’s
    decision to allow EU ships to fish in UK waters, taking significant catches.
    These arrangements expire next year, opening the door for a new commitment
    on this front. </p>
  <p>The <a
      href="https://commonslibrary.parliament.uk/research-briefings/cbp-9174/">2021
      fisheries deal</a> allowed EU ships to fish in the UK waters, and British
    fishers want the next deal to be less generous to the EU. British fishing
    makes up a tiny role in the British economy, but right-leaning British
    politicians attach nostalgia to the trade. It provokes feelings of
    nationalism and days gone past, of fish and chip shops which are a
    cornerstone of British culture and cuisine. Conservatives may want to
    consider that <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/52420116">55% of English
      fishing fleet quotas were delivered to EU countries</a>. The UK needs
    access to these markets if they truly want to keep their fishing industry
    alive, something that is not guaranteed if they force worse fishing rights
    for EU ships. EU coastal states like France and Denmark have already
    signaled that they will not stand down easily, looking to force concessions
    on fishing rights from London in exchange for access to their markets. </p>
  <p><strong>The Migration Tug-of-War</strong></p>
  <p>Starmer sees rejoining the EU’s crime and illegal migration database as a
    win-win situation. Intelligence cooperation would allow both blocs to combat
    terrorism, gangs, and illegal migration more effectively. He also wants to
    rejoin the <a
      href="https://home-affairs.ec.europa.eu/policies/migration-and-asylum/asylum-eu/country-responsible-asylum-application-dublin-regulation_en">Dublin
      Agreement</a>, allowing Britain the right to send back illegal migrants
    who arrived from EU member states. </p>
  <p>The EU uses the European Arrest Warrant, Europol, and the Schengen
    Information System, which are designed specifically for member states. The
    EAW streamlines extradition processes across the EU, allowing for swift
    cross-border arrests and transfers of suspects. Europol serves as the EU’s
    central agency for criminal intelligence, facilitating coordination in
    tackling serious organised crime and terrorism. Meanwhile, the SIS enables
    real-time sharing of data on wanted individuals, missing persons, stolen
    property, and potential security threats. Since these mechanisms are
    designed with full EU membership in mind, the UK’s exclusion post-Brexit has
    significantly hampered its ability to collaborate effectively on
    cross-border policing and security.</p>

    der Leyen in Brussels (Omar Havana/AP) (AP)</p>
  <p>When the UK chose to leave the European Union, it also relinquished its
    automatic rights to access critical EU databases. It was sacrificed, in
    part, on the altar of sovereignty. EU officials have since accused Britain
    of attempting to cherry-pick: seeking the advantages of membership without
    accepting the responsibilities that come with it. If the UK hopes to regain
    access to these vital tools; particularly to address pressing migration and
    security challenges, it will need to offer meaningful concessions, whether
    in defence cooperation or other strategic areas. London must demonstrate to
    its EU counterparts that it is prepared to engage in a balanced, reciprocal
    partnership, one where it gives as much as it expects to receive.</p>
  <p><strong>Edge of an Unknown Tomorrow</strong></p>
  <p>May 19th has the potential to mark a turning point in UK–EU relations, one
    that could lay the foundation for a more unified global order. Such a shift
    would see the UK share the burden of European defence alongside France,
    Germany, and Poland, reinforcing collective security not only for the
    continent but potentially on a global scale. Greater unity would project
    strength, and enhanced interoperability could pave the way for a more
    assertive European Union, one less vulnerable to coercion from adversaries
    like Russia.</p>
  <p>However, Starmer’s messaging on the issue remains inconsistent, leaving the
    government’s position ambiguous. On one hand, he speaks of resetting
    relations with the EU; on the other, he remains bound by the Brexit-era red
    lines. He rules out the return of free movement, yet supports the
    reintroduction of a youth mobility scheme that closely mirrors it. He
    rejects rejoining the single market, yet advocates for deeper cooperation in
    defence and agriculture, areas that may require alignment with EU
    regulations. This ambiguity risks undermining trust on both sides, making it
    harder to build the very partnerships the UK now needs. Making Brexit work
    may not be in the cards.</p>
  <p>The truth is, Brexit was a mistake. While Prime Minister Keir Starmer
    cannot fully reverse the damage, he faces a complex political landscape that
    demands caution. A full retreat risks alienating Leave voters and could open
    the door for the Reform Party (already making gains, as seen in the <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/election/2025/england/results">May 2nd
      local elections</a>) to siphon support. Starmer’s challenge is to mitigate
    the lasting economic harm of Brexit, including the estimated <a
      href="https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-03-07/uk-is-on-track-for-4-hit-to-economy-from-brexit-obr-says">4%
      blow to the UK economy</a>, while maintaining political stability. At the
    same time, he must tread carefully with Washington, particularly in light of
    <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c15ng4g5g0eo">recent trade
      agreements</a>. Yet in an era defined by unpredictability, where a U.S.
    president can impose tariffs one day and revoke them the next, placing too
    much trust in the "special relationship" is risky. Should Donald Trump
    return to office and renege on the deal, the UK could find itself facing 20%
    tariffs and a shattered transatlantic alliance.</p>
  <p>Despite Brexit, the European Union remains the UK's largest trading
    partner, <a
      href="https://committees.parliament.uk/committee/365/business-and-trade-committee/news/206830/the-brussels-dividend-commons-committee-urges-strategic-reset-with-europe-to-unlock-growth-and-security/">with
      41% of British goods still destined for EU markets</a>. This is more than
    the United States, India, and the entire Indo-Pacific region combined. The
    EU offers stability, predictability, and reliability — qualities essential
    for forging long-term, mutually beneficial agreements. Rather than clinging
    to the uncertain promise of rescue from NATO or over-relying on the United
    States, the UK must now prioritise rebuilding strong, strategic ties with
    its European neighbours. Brexit was a historic miscalculation, but this
    summit presents a vital opportunity to begin correcting that course.</p>
