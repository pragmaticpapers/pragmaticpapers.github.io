  <p><strong>The Road to Brexit </strong></p>
  <p>Thomas R. Ullmann </p>
  <p><strong>Introduction </strong></p>
  <p>There is considerable merit to the claim that the European Union (EU) the
    United Kingdom (UK) left in 2016 bore only a passing resemblance to the
    organization it had joined in 1973. Tracing this long and winding road
    demands that we follow two intertwined threads: the steady deepening of
    European integration and the equally steady rise of British Euroscepticism,
    nourished by demographic shifts, economic shocks, and a tabloid press ever
    ready to turn grievance into headline. </p>
  <p>For clarity, the essay is arranged in short, tightly focused subsections.
    Read together, they form a single narrative arc from postwar idealism to the
    rancorous politics of the 2010s. </p>
  <p><strong>Origins: From Coal and Steel to EEC Membership </strong></p>
  <p>In the immediate aftermath of the Second World War, Jean Monnet and others
    proposed pooling the sinews of war-coal and steel-to make any future
    European conflict “not merely unthinkable, but materially impossible”. The
    resulting <em>European Coal and Steel Community </em>(ECSC) came into being
    in 1951. Its economic logic broadened with the 1957 <em>Treaties of
      Rome</em>, which founded the <em>European Economic Community </em>(EEC).
  </p>
  <p>While Winston Churchill sketched a <a
      href="https://youtu.be/giilcPJsYuw?si=1inqam99U_QMdl7t">“United States of
      Europe”</a> in 1946 [1], the early treaties remained cautious about
    supranational politics. Even so, French President Charles de Gaulle feared
    Anglo-American influence and twice vetoed British entry. Only after his
    resignation in 1969 did negotiations advance, and on January 1st, 1973, the
    UK finally joined the EEC. </p>
  <p>The 2016 Brexit referendum was not the first plebiscite on membership. In
    1975 Harold Wilson’s Labour government put continued EEC membership to a
    popular vote. With both Wilson and Conservative leader Margaret Thatcher on
    the same side, <em>Remain </em>carried the day with 67.2% of the vote [2].
    Opposition figures ranged from Labours democratic-socialist Tony Benn to
    right-wing Conservative Enoch Powell, foreshadowing the unlikely alliances
    of 2016. It should be noted that Tony Benn was the mentor to Jeremy Corbyn,
    the future Labour leader who would lead the Labour party during the 2016
    referendum. </p>
  <p>It would be improper, however, to lump Benn and Powell together
    ideologically. The Labour rebels decried a democratic deficit that they
    believed would hamper future socialist governments, whereas Powell warned
    that membership threatened national identity and Britain's ability to
    negotiate its own trade deals. “We have ceased to be a democratic nation
    because we are no longer governed by our own Parliament,” he declared,
    though by his logic regional assemblies inside the UK could make the same
    complaint. </p>
  <p><strong>The Maastricht Shock and Black Wednesday </strong></p>
  <p>Direct elections to the European Parliament in 1979 nudged the project
    toward parliamentary politics, but the watershed was the 1992 <em>Maastricht
      Treaty</em>. Maastricht rechristened the bloc the <em>European Union</em>,
    introduced EU citizenship, and laid the foundation for a single currency. To
    many Britons, including an increasingly vocal group of Conservative
    back-benchers,this looked suspiciously like a federal project undertaken by
    stealth. </p>
  <p>The <em>European Exchange Rate Mechanism </em>(ERM), a precursor to the
    euro, required participating states to treat the German Deutschmark as an
    anchor currency and to stabilise exchange rates within agreed bands. During
    Margaret Thatcher’s final years in office she insisted on a strong sterling
    rate, ignoring warnings that the pound was over-valued. By 1992, under her
    successor John Majorthe, the strain broke. Pinning the pound to a higher
    value was one of Thatcher’s greatest failures. </p>
  <p>There are many facets to the crescendo of this economic mismanagement. Once
    markets realised the pound was mis-priced, speculators such as George Soros
    short-sold sterling, forcing the Treasury to spend vast reserves even as the
    economy slid into recession. Because devaluation was ruled out under ERM
    rules, the only remaining lever was interest rates. The Bank of England (not
    yet independent) raised rates twice in one dayfrom 10% to 15%a gesture so
    desperate it merely invited further attacks. On 16 September 1992 this death
    spiral lead to the UK crashing out of the ERM, the stock market plunged, and
    sterling devalued: <em>Black Wednesday</em>. </p>

  <p>Eurosceptic tabloids framed the crisis as proof that European
    entanglementsmeant national humiliation. The Sun snarled, “This is the price
    we pay for dancing to the German tune” [3]; the Daily Mail fumed, “The
    Bundesbank dictated terms-and our government obeyed” [4]. Content analysis
    by Andreas Peters later showed that anti-EU stories in major tabloids more
    than tripled between 1990 and 1994 [5].</p>
  <p><strong>From the AntiFederalist League to UKIP </strong></p>
  <p>Black Wednesday appeared to delegitimize pro-European arguments on the
    right and breathed life into the nascent <em>Anti-Federalist League
    </em>(AFL), founded in late 1992. Re-launched as the <em>United Kingdom
      Independence Party </em>(UKIP) in 1993, it recruited former Conservative
    activists-most notably Nigel Farage, who joined in 1994. Farage’s
    schoolmates recalled his pride that his initials matched “NF”, the National
    Front, and Michael Crick documents how, well into the 2000s, Farage courted
    BNP defectors [6]. </p>
  <p>UKIP fared badly in Westminster elections but flourished under the
    proportional system used for the European Parliament, winning three seats in
    1999, twelve in 2004, and topping the 2014 poll with 27%. David Cameron
    could no longer ignore the insurgency on his right flank. </p>
  <p><strong>The 2015 Election and Camerons Gambit </strong></p>
  <p>2015 saw a general election that was somewhat unusual for the UK. With the
    UK having a first past the post electoral system coalition government are a
    rarity but from 2010-2015 the Conservatives and Liberal Democrats went hand
    in hand into government. This marred both parties into an identity crisis
    with both parties in the 2015 election needing to distance themselves from
    one another, pushing the conservatives rightwards. David Cameron, the then
    prime minister and leader of the conservatives was a social liberal whose
    economic leanings were centre right. </p>
  <p>To placate his Eurosceptic back-benchers and staunch the bleed of votes to
    UKIP, Cameron promised an in/out referendum in the 2015 manifesto. When he
    unexpectedly secured a majority in May 2015, the promise became an
    unavoidable commitment. </p>
  <p><strong>The Referendum Campaign (2016) </strong></p>
  <p>With the Conservatives winning a majority in the 2015 election, the 2016
    referendum became inevitable. David Cameron had miscalculated several key
    variables. One was the leanings of Boris Johnson. Until early 2016 his </p>
  <p>position was unclear, even though he had often spoken fondly of the
    continent, having attended school in Brussels. In February 2016-mere months
    before the vote-Johnson declared his support for Brexit. Likewise, Michael
    Gove, the then Justice Secretary, aligned with Johnson, much to Cameron’s
    dismay [7]. </p>
  <p>This marked a sharp contrast with 1975: in 2016 figures long considered
    moderate were swayed by the Leave campaign. </p>
  <p>The position of Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn remains hotly debated. Echoing
    concerns once voiced by his mentor Tony Benn, Corbyn adopted a "Remain and
    Reform" stance, arguing that the EU was important but required deep social
    reform. Yet he delivered few pro-Remain speeches mirroring the reticence of
    several senior politicians, including future Conservative Prime Minister
    Theresa May. </p>
  <p>Cameron also underestimated the impact of funding and social media. The
    Leave side comprised an official <em>Vote Leave </em>campaign and the
    unofficial <em>Leave.EU</em>. Together they raised just over č7 million,
    compared with č6.8 million for the Remain campaign [8]. </p>
  <p>Roughly 40 % of Leave spending went on digital advertising via AggregateIQ
    (AIQ) and Cambridge Analytica, with heavy use of tailored Facebook ads. AIQ
    alone served more than one billion targeted impressions, most in the final
    ten days [9, 10]. By contrast, Leave ran a minimalist ground campaign. </p>
  <p>Leave messaging revolved around slogans and fear-mongering: the promise of
    extra money for the NHS, and warnings that Turkey might join the EU,
    unleashing mass migration. The rallying cry Take back control deliberately
    echoed the 1975 referendum. </p>
  <p>AIQs demographic targeting focused on older voters, those with lower
    educational attainment, and post-industrial towns. The 2008 financial crisis
    had scarred many such communities, leaving them vulnerable to manipulation.
    In districts where fewer than 25 % of adults held a university degree, more
    than 65 % voted Leave. These areas-including Lincolnshire, the Midlands, and
    coastal Kent-received especially high volumes of AIQ ads between 10 and 23
    June [11]. </p>
  <p><strong>The legacy of Brexit </strong></p>
  <p>On 23 June, by a margin of just over one million votes, Leave triumphed-an
    outcome many view as an act of economic self-harm that disproportionately
    hurt the very communities that backed it. Article 50 was triggered the </p>
  <p>following March, and formal withdrawal occurred on 31 January 2020. The
    process of fully implementing Brexit is still ongoing. </p>
  <p>Debate continues over whether Brexit restores sovereignty, or even
    effectively decreases sovereignty without a say in European elections,
    entrenching new vulnerabilities. Nonetheless, few deny that the result
    consummated decades of political, economic, and cultural drift compounded by
    shrewd electioneering. </p>
