  <h4><a id="_wo1cnjd0dztk"></a>The path to impeachment</h4>
  <p> Trump's first 100 days have been worse than anyone had imagined - but each
    of his blunders and attacks on democracy carries with it a silver lining.
    His approval rating fell by ~1% in the week following the signal scandal.
    Another 3% drop came after “Liberation day” where Trump liberated us from
    the burdens of materialism by disrupting global trade with his shocking
    tariffs.<sup>1,2</sup> This week, even his most staunch allies have spoken
    out against his acceptance of a half-billion dollar bribe - it would not be
    unreasonable to expect him to take another hit in the polls. What happens if
    his approval continues to fall? If Republicans are demolished in the
    midterms? If Trump can no longer primary any Neocon he wants with a maggot
    loyalist? You are right that the odds of impeachment are slim - but there is
    a path to get there, and we need to take every step we can along it.</p>
  <h4><a id="_yk4pxu59ivd8"></a>Impeachment 101</h4>
  <p> The process we colloquially refer to as impeachment allows Congress to
    remove from office any Civil Officer that they convict of Treason, Bribery,
    or other high Crimes and Misdemeanors. The House of Representatives is
    granted the “Power of Impeachment” by the Constitution, effectively allowing
    them to charge officials with crimes. The Senate is granted the “Power to
    try all impeachments”, allowing them to vote to convict the charged
    official, and to determine their punishment. However, the selection is
    limited: it may “not extend further than to removal from Office, and
    disqualification to hold and enjoy any Office of honor, Trust or Profit
    under the United States”. Intuitively, the Senate can’t imprison their
    political opponents - impeachment is purely a process for removing them from
    office.<sup>3</sup></p>
  <p>A few additional notes:</p>
  <ul>
    <li>What qualifies as “High Crimes and Misdemeanors” is up to
      interpretation, but is ultimately up to congress. The Supreme Courts have
      agreed that impeachment is separate from the judicial system.<sup>4</sup>
    </li>
    <li>White the Supreme Court does not intervene in impeachment, the Chief
      Justice presides over a session where the Senate votes to impeach -
      lending their supreme and final authority to the process.</li>
    <li>House Rule IX allows any house member to force a vote on issues related
      to the “rights of the house, its integrity or core powers”. On May 13,
      Michigan Rep Shri Thanedar invoked this power to force an impeachment
      vote, but withdrew his articles the next day.<sup>5</sup> </li>
  </ul>
  <h4><a id="_efdr25mtvb4d"></a>What does the path to impeachment look like?
  </h4>
  <p> There have been 4 impeachments in US history - half of them were against
    Donald Trump. They leave a fitting stain on his legacy, and will be
    remembered long after the details of his weekly controversies are forgotten.
    Democrats do not control the house today, so any impeachment efforts are
    likely to fail. But with 80% betting odds to take it back in ‘26, we can
    expect successful impeachments, potentially multiple, after the
    midterms.<sup>6</sup></p>
  <p> Conviction and removal from office is extraordinarily unlikely - even in
    the best case scenario of a complete blowout midterm. With current Senate
    predictions, we would need the votes of ~17 Republican Senators, or the
    unprecedented swing of a dozen seats.<sup>6</sup> Nothing is ever off the
    table with Trump - he has an uncanny ability to defy odds and stretch the
    boundaries of what seems politically possible far out in every direction.
    But conviction is not a reasonable outcome to expect for the foreseeable
    future. </p>
  <h4><a id="_8k74d3atd4bz"></a>The argument for Impeachment</h4>
  <p> It is my belief that the Trump administration should receive a vigorous,
    unrelenting immune-response from every decent person in government. I want,
    when kids learn about impeachment in school, to have to ask their teacher
    why half of all impeachments in history have gone to one man. I want them to
    hear about his 400m dollar jet, his attempts to undermine democracy, his
    attempts to blackmail Ukraine into investigating his political opponents.
    People raise concerns that he commits impeachable offences as he breathes,
    and that raising all of them would make us look unhinged. I say we plant a
    flag in the ground, set a standard, and raise for impeachment every single
    action he takes that falls below that standard. Let Republicans vote that
    taking half-million dollar bribes is acceptable conduct for a POTUS.</p>

  <p> Democrat leadership disagrees. They feel that a destined-to-fail
    impeachment effort would distract from the talking points they want to focus
    their messaging on: Medicare cuts. But this top-down strategy misunderstands
    the modern media landscape. The “Monoculture” is gone, and everyone is
    fragmented into their own media ecosystems filled to the brim with issues
    they care about. Issues that resonate will reach their target audiences
    naturally: Instead of attempting to maintain top-down messaging control in
    the sprawling jungle of new media, Democrats need to embrace change and
    welcome everyone to fight on whatever ground they can, then nurture the
    messaging that resonates most strongly with their base and their goals. </p>
  <h4><a id="_yj68hcq38vzb"></a>Take the next step</h4>
  <p> Whether you support raising articles of impeachment every week, or would
    rather we wait until after the midterms to launch impeachment efforts that
    are guaranteed to succeed, the time to start laying the groundwork is now.
    Citizens Impeachment is the main group pushing forward impeachment efforts,
    and it was their proposed articles that were filed (and dropped) earlier
    this week, after being sent to congress in a campaign we participated in.
  </p>
  <p> This week, we will be reaching out to our congressional offices again - an
    excellent first step for anyone interested in starting their political
    journey. Join the <a href="https://discord.gg/yhAHQcTZ">political action
