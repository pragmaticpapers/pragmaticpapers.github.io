  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

      Order 14290 Ending Taxpayer Subsidization of Biased Media</a></p>
  <p>Signed: May 1, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 7, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 states that the media landscape is currently more diverse than it
    was when the Corporation for Public Broadcasting (“CPB”) was founded in
    1967. It also says that the CPB does not follow statutes regarding unbiased
    political broadcasting. Therefore the CPB is to end all federal funding for
    NPR and PBS.</p>
  <p>Section 2 reiterates the order to cease all funding to NPR and PBS to
    prevent biased news reporting. Further it directs the CPB to take actions to
    halt all indirect funding to NPR and PBS.</p>
  <p>Section 3 instructs all agency heads to eliminate any forms of direct or
    indirect funding to NPR and PBS. It also directs the Secretary of HHS to
    determine if NPR is complying with discriminatory hiring laws.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>The CPB was created in 1967 to promote public education and reporting.
    While there is a requirement for unbiased broadcasting, both NPR and PBS
    both attempt to refrain from biased broadcasting. This act now will withdraw
    and attempt to impede any funding of these programs.</p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>PBS and NPR are both well liked and provide a lot of free public education
    to lower income Americans. This EO will likely spell the end of these
    organizations entirely to the suffering of low-income Americans, and to the
    very slight benefit of the wealthy that own private broadcasting networks.

      Order 14291 Establishment of the Religious Liberty Commission</a></p>
  <p>Signed: May 1, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 7, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 establishes that the policy of the executive branch is to enforce
    religious liberties. It goes on for a bit about this, with no real point.
  </p>
  <p>Section 2 establishes the Religious Liberty Commission to defend religious
    liberty for all Americans. The Commission essentially just acts as an
    advisory committee to the executive regarding religious policy in America.
  </p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This has long been foretold to be a Christian Nationalist commission to
    suppress non-christians and promote christianity in all aspects of society.
    The language of this EO is pretty tame, and all references to it by the
    Administration have included references to faiths other than Christianity.
  </p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>The altruism of the Administrations regarding different religions should
    not be trusted. It is likely a pretext for the Commission that will protect
    religious schools taking federal funds, christian employers enforcing their
    views on employees, and the illegal promotion of the Christian religion by
    the state.</p>

      Order 14292 Improving the Safety and Security of Biological Research</a>
  </p>
  <p>Signed: May 5, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 8, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 does some fear mongering about gain-of-function research and
    blames it for Covid-19.</p>
  <p>Section 2 states it is the policy of the US to ensure that federally funded
    research benefits Americans without jeopardizing the Nation’s security,
    strength, or prosperity.</p>
  <p>Section 3 orders various Executive officials to establish guidance to
    immediately federal funding of gain-of-function research in foreign
    countries and domestically.</p>
  <p>Section 4 requires stronger oversight regarding gain-of-function and its
    funding.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders various executive officers to come up with a plan to
    govern, limit, and track ongoing dangerous gain-of-function research in the
    US that occurs without federal funding.</p>
  <p>Section 6 creates a hotline for the public to report gain-of-function
    research to the government and receive a reward.</p>
  <p>Section 7 orders various executive officers to include in all life-science
    research contract that the funds provided cannot be used for
    gain-of-function research.</p>
  <p>Section 8 creates definitions for the EO.</p>

  </div>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This will end funding to research regarding gain-of-function research, and
    likely impact life science funding generally. Not only does this attempt to
    affect American research domestically, but it intends to impact
    international gain-of-life research and become an impediment in helping
    combat dangerous diseases.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>I am not knowledgeable enough in this area to know the impact of this EO. I
    can guess that it will only serve to harm humanity generally by impeding the
    progress of combating diseases.</p>

  <p>Signed: May 5, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: May 8, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 complains about regulatory barriers to building pharmaceutical
    manufacturing facilities in America.</p>
  <p>Section 2 states that the policy of the US is that the regulation of
    manufacture of pharmaceutical products and inputs be streamlined.</p>
  <p>Section 3 orders various executive officials to review regulations and
    guidance regarding pharmaceutical manufacturing to remove unnecessary
    regulations and maximize the speed of new pharmaceutical manufacturing. It
    also orders these officials to make positive steps to help increase said
    manufacturing.</p>
  <p>Section 4 requires the FDA Commissioner to develop and improve inspection
    regimes of overseas manufacturing facilities that provide medicine to the
    US.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the head of the EPA to take action to update regulations
    and guidance for the inspection and approval of new pharmaceutical
    manufacturing facilities.</p>
  <p>Section 6 selects the EPA as the lead agency for the permitting of new
    pharmaceutical facilities.</p>
  <p>Section 7 orders various Secretaries to review nationwide permits to
    determine if nationwide permits are needed to facilitate the efficient
    permitting of pharmaceutical manufacturing facilities.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO attempts to assist domestic pharmaceutical manufacturing. While the
    intent is present, there is little in this EO to actually achieve this goal.
    Should the disassembly of the EPA be successful, then at the very least it
    may remove the environmental impact studies required for the construction of
    such facilities.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>It is unclear how impactful this EO will be. I am not familiar enough with
    this industry to know if manufacturing is the bottleneck that has been a
    major issue for Pharmaceuticals. This EO will likely be pair in discussions
    with his other EOs regarding prescription drugs as the Administration’s
    attempts to lower drug prices.</p>
