  <p><strong>May 11th, Sunday:</strong> A bit of diplomatic back-and-forth
    signaled that for the first time since the war began, President Zelenskyy
    and Putin might actually meet face-to-face. <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/putin-proposes-direct-talks-with-ukraine-may-15-2025-05-10/">Putin</a>
    issued a statement, suspiciously timed to align with U.S. prime time,
    proposing direct talks in Istanbul on Thursday, May 15. It was a clear play
    to derail the sanctions threatened by European leaders if Moscow didn’t
    accept the 30-day ceasefire. In Putin’s mind, maybe just <em>agreeing</em>
    to a meeting would buy him time and keep sanctions at bay. Zelenskyy, for
    his part, responded fairly quickly, saying he’d meet <em>if</em> the
    ceasefire was in place beforehand. But then Trump jumped on Truth Social,
    firing off a demand that Ukraine “IMMEDIATELY” agree to the talks, which
    undermined Zelenskyy’s position and, once again, cracked the unified front.
    That gap between Kyiv, Washington, and Europe gave Russia just enough room
    to dodge the ceasefire but still walk into Thursday’s meeting looking like
    the reasonable one.</p>
  <p><strong>Monday, May 12th:</strong> The stage continued getting set for
    Thursday’s proposed meeting in Istanbul, with <a
      href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/12/trump-travel-russia-ukraine-peace-talks-00341968">President
      Trump</a> hinting at the possibility of personally flying to Turkey. Trump
    stated, “I would fly there if I thought it would be helpful,” despite the
    fact that Trump was already scheduled to travel across the Middle East this
    week. The comment did feel more like posturing than anything but regardless,
    it certainly added pressure on Russia to attend the meeting, just in case.
    Meanwhile, <a
      href="https://www.vaticannews.va/en/pope/news/2025-05/pope-leo-and-ukraine-s-president-zelensky-speak-by-phone.html">Pope
      Leo XIV</a> managed to get in touch with President Zelenskyy and publicly
    backed his desire for a ceasefire. Zelenskyy used the moment to invite the
    Pope to visit Ukraine, emphasizing the need for international unity and
    moral pressure against Russia’s ongoing war.</p>
  <p><strong>Tuesday, May 13th:</strong> Tensions mounted as the Istanbul peace
    talks drew nearer, with <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/rubio-discusses-way-forward-ukraine-ceasefire-with-european-counterparts-2025-05-13/">Zelenskyy</a>
    publicly declaring he would only attend if Putin showed up in person, daring
    the Russian leader to face him directly. The Kremlin, unsurprisingly, still
    hadn’t confirmed Putin’s attendance, which led Ukraine’s presidential <a
      href="https://www.politico.com/news/2025/05/13/yermak-interview-russia-ukraine-00344369">chief
      of staff Andriy Yermak</a> to call for new sanctions should he back out.
    President Trump, meanwhile, doubled down on his commitment to the talks,
    dispatching <a
      href="https://www.dw.com/en/ukraine-zelenskyy-says-hell-wait-for-putin-in-turkey/a-72532696">Marco
      Rubio, Steve Witkoff, and Keith Kellogg</a> to Istanbul, and once again
    teasing the idea of attending himself if both leaders were present. With
    mounting pressure from both the U.S. and EU, and drone attacks continuing
    across Ukraine, the proposed ceasefire and potential face-to-face
    negotiations seemed to teeter on the edge of either breakthrough or
    breakdown.</p>
  <p><strong>Wednesday, May 14th:</strong> It finally became official: <a
      href="https://www.axios.com/2025/05/14/ukraine-russia-summit-talks-putin-trump-zelensky">Putin</a>
    would not be attending Thursday’s peace summit in Istanbul, and instead was
    opting to send a lower-level delegation led by advisor Vladimir Medinsky. <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Vladimir_Medinsky">Medinsky</a>
    himself is a Russian Nationalist, having publicly pushed for the creation of
    a “patriotic internet” to combat Western ideas and values in Russia, to
    update the Cultural Policy to entirely reject multiculturalism and embrace
    Russian “traditional Values”. I could go on and on about this guy and how
    absolutely insane he is, but just check it for yourself; he's also a big
    proponent of these odd new <a
      href="https://www.thebarentsobserver.com/news/washing-young-brains-in-murmansk-vladimir-medinsky-came-to-town/231719">Hitler
      Youth-style militant schools</a>. This effectively derailed any chance of
    the long-hyped three-way meeting between Trump, Zelenskyy, and Putin, and
    drew sharp disappointment from both Ukraine and U.S. officials. Meanwhile,
    the<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/14/world/europe/russia-ukraine-ceasefire-putin-zelensky-sanctions.html">
      New York Times reported</a> that Putin’s decision was more tactical than
    symbolic. Russian officials believe they are winning on the battlefield,
    having made costly but incremental gains, and are now making maximalist
    demands in talks, like keeping all annexed Ukrainian territory and limiting
    Ukraine’s future military size. On a separate but related front, Germany
    arrested three Ukrainian nationals allegedly working for Russian
    intelligence, who were planning to ship explosive devices hidden in freight
    bound for Ukraine.

  <p><strong>Thursday, May 15th:</strong> The long-awaited peace talks in Turkey
    were quickly thrown into disarray. With<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/15/world/europe/russia-ukraine-putin-zelensky-ceasefire-trump.html">
      Zelenskyy</a> arriving in Ankara and Russia’s lower-level delegation
    stationed in Istanbul, the two sides were physically and diplomatically
    misaligned from the start. Zelenskyy publicly condemned Moscow’s decision to
    send what he called a “decorative” delegation, calling it a sign of
    disrespect to Turkey, the U.S., and the entire peace effort. He ultimately
    agreed to send Ukraine’s defense minister to Istanbul just to keep a seat at
    the table, but expectations were low. President Trump, meanwhile, stayed in
    the Gulf and dismissed the talks altogether, stating that <em>“nothing’s
      going to happen until Putin and I get together.”</em> Secretary of State
    Marco Rubio echoed that sentiment, expressing little hope for breakthroughs.
    Amid the chaos, Putin remained in Moscow, meeting with a bank CEO, leaving
    it painfully clear that the summit was not a serious priority for the
    Kremlin.</p>
  <p><strong>Friday, May 16th:</strong> The long-awaited<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-peace-talks.html">
      Istanbul peace talks</a> finally took place, but with results that fell
    way short of any real progress. The only tangible outcome was an agreement
    to conduct the largest prisoner swap of the war, 1,000 captives each, but
    hopes for a ceasefire quickly fell apart. Russia’s lead negotiator, the
    totally not insane, Vladimir Medinsky, made sweeping demands, stating
    Ukraine must fully withdraw from all four annexed regions, Donetsk, Luhansk,
    Kherson, and Zaporizhzhya, just to begin discussing a ceasefire. When
    Ukrainian officials pushed back, Russia reportedly warned, “Next time it
    will be five.” Medinsky even doubled down on Moscow’s resolve, saying,
    <em>“We don’t want war, but we’re ready to fight … We fought Sweden for 21
      years. How long are you ready to fight?”</em> Zelenskyy, then<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2025/05/16/world/europe/russia-ukraine-prisoner-swap-talks.html">
      speaking from Albania</a>, slammed the talks as a “staged, empty process,”
    and called for harsher sanctions on Russia’s energy and banking sectors.
    Meanwhile, President Trump, now back in Washington, said he hoped to meet
    with Putin “as soon as we can set it up.” Though Russia framed the talks as
    constructive, their terms were described by one Ukrainian source as
    “detached from reality,”.</p>

  <p><strong>Saturday, May 17th:</strong> <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/russia-demanded-kyiv-pull-back-troops-before-ceasefire-ukrainian-source-says-2025-05-17/">President
      Trump</a> announced that he would speak with both Putin and Zelenskyy on
    Monday, calling for an end to the “bloodbath”. He also said he would reach
    out to NATO leaders after the calls, declaring his hope for a productive day
    that could end the war relatively soon, perhaps the “ending the war in 24
    hours” begins then? Trump’s team insists diplomacy is moving forward,
    Secretary of State Marco Rubio even calling the Vatican a potential venue
    for future talks, but the reality remains bleak given the follow-through
    from the Trump Administration. Meanwhile Zelenskyy urged stronger sanctions
    after a Russian drone strike killed nine civilians in Sumy, stating plainly
    that without more pressure, “Russia will not seek real diplomacy.” The
    Kremlin, while agreeing in principle to a Trump–Putin call, reiterated that
    any real summit would require “careful preparation.” With Trump back in
    D.C., Putin dug in his heels, and Ukraine scrambling to keep support
    aligned, Monday’s calls are more than likely going to be a waste.</p>
