  <p>On April 2nd, 2025, Donald Trump unveiled new, vast tariff hikes, the likes
    of which haven’t been seen in the US since the 1930s and the Smoot-Hawley
    Tariff act. “Liberation Day” <a
      href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rcoAYkb6gYg&amp;t=36s">as Trump
      called it</a> “will forever be remembered as the day American industry was
    reborn, the day America’s <a href="https://www.destiny.gg/">destiny</a> was
    reclaimed, and the day that we began to make America wealthy again.” The
    stock market immediately responded, with the DOW, S&amp;P 500, and NASDAQ
    all dropping roughly 10% by close on <a
      href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/04/investing/stock-market-dow-tariffs/index.html">Friday,
      April 4th</a>. Let’s take a look at a historic move that economists are
    calling “<a
      href="https://bsky.app/profile/justinwolfers.bsky.social/post/3llvttymhfr2g">indescribably
      crazy</a>”, “<a
      href="https://x.com/LHSummers/status/1907603075239383463">masochistic</a>”,
    and “<a
      href="https://paulkrugman.substack.com/p/will-careless-stupidity-kill-the">sheer,
      malignant stupidity</a>”. </p>
  <h2><a id="_kpob85pufxkg"></a>So what exactly did Trump do?</h2>
  <p>On Wednesday, Donald Trump signed <a
      href="https://public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2025-06027.pdf">Executive
      Order 14256</a>, which formally declares a national emergency and <a
      href="https://www.vox.com/scotus/407051/supreme-court-trump-tariffs-major-questions">gives
      Trump an insane amount of authority</a> over tariffs. Using this
    authority, Trump imposed a <a
      href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/fact-sheets/2025/04/fact-sheet-president-donald-j-trump-declares-national-emergency-to-increase-our-competitive-edge-protect-our-sovereignty-and-strengthen-our-national-and-economic-security/">baseline
      tariff of 10%</a> for all countries, and individualized tariffs for 60
    countries. These include;</p>
  <ul>
    <li>20% to the European Union</li>
    <li>34% to China (bringing their total to 54%)</li>
    <li>24% to Japan</li>
    <li>46% to Vietnam</li>
  </ul>
  <p>And a <a
      href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/business/trumps-reciprocal-tariffs-countries-list-dg/index.html">whole
      lot more</a>. Notably, there are a few big names missing off of the list.
    Mexico and Canada managed to avoid this round of tariffs, but they are
    already subject to 25% on goods that aren't compliant with the <a
      href="https://ustr.gov/trade-agreements/free-trade-agreements/united-states-mexico-canada-agreement">United
      States-Mexico-Canada Agreement</a>. Russia was kept off because they
    already had pre-existing sanctions due to the war in Ukraine, according to
    the <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/cdjl3k1we8vo.amp">White House
      and Russian state media</a>. North Korea, Cuba, and Belarus have avoided
    tariffs as well, once again <a
      href="https://thehill.com/homenews/administration/5229844-white-house-donald-trump-tariffs-russia-north-korea/">due
      to already high sanctions.</a></p>

  <h2><a id="_45hg1od6oui"></a>How did they get these numbers?</h2>
  <p>The official answer was posted by the <a
      href="https://ustr.gov/issue-areas/reciprocal-tariff-calculations">Office
      of the U.S. Trade Representative</a>. Simply put, it’s the country’s trade
    deficit divided by its exports to the United States times 1/2. Now you might
    be thinking “gosh, this seems really simple! I thought making tariffs truly
    reciprocal and match dollar for dollar would be really hard, considering the
    complexities of international trade and foreign economies.” </p>
  <p><a
      href="https://edition.cnn.com/2025/04/03/economy/reciprocal-tariff-math/index.html">You’d
      be correct</a>. Paul Krugman, Nobel Prize winning economist, points out
    that Trump’s calculations only considers trade in GOODS, and not <a
      href="https://www.wto.org/english/thewto_e/20y_e/services_brochure2015_e.pdf">trade
      in SERVICES</a>, for example IT support. Considering the USA has been a
    service based economy since the <a
      href="https://www.nationalaffairs.com/public_interest/detail/the-first-service-economy">50’s/60’s</a>,
    this is one of <a
      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/05/economists-take-issue-with-trumps-tariff-formula-arguing-rate-is-inflated.html">many
      egregious mistakes</a> with the way these tariffs were calculated. Even
    the majority of the economists referenced in the Office of the U.S. Trade
    Representative’s blog post have spoken out, basically stating that their
    work is <a
      href="https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-white-house-cited-these-economists-to-justify-its-tariffs-they-arent-thrilled-193615537.html">not
      being applied correctly</a> by the administration. The disconnect between
    economists' opinions on the method and the similarities to methods produced
    by <a
      href="https://www.newsweek.com/donald-trump-tariffs-chatgpt-2055203">chatGPT,
      if asked</a>, have led to speculation that the formula is made by the AI
    chatbot. Regardless of how the tariffs were created, the results have even
    top Trump donors <a
      href="https://www.rollingstone.com/politics/politics-news/trump-shares-post-purposely-crashing-stock-market-1235310745/">scared
      of what’s to come next</a>. </p>
  <h2><a id="_2cdwvg9r614c"></a>How will this affect the economy?</h2>
  <p>Well, put quite simply, <a
      href="https://truthsocial.com/@realDonaldTrump/114285375813275308">it’s
      gonna hurt</a>. A <a
      href="https://www.elephango.com/index.cfm/pg/k12learning/lcid/14356/Tariffs:_The_Price_Tag_on_Trade!">high
      school level economics</a> class would teach you that tariffs raise
    prices, which seems counterproductive to <a
      href="https://www.ebay.com/itm/365185327824">Trump’s campaign
      promises</a>. Jerome Powell, chairman of the federal reserve, said these
    tariffs will <a
      href="https://www.pbs.org/newshour/politics/watch-live-fed-chair-powell-delivers-remarks-as-global-markets-roiled-by-trump-tariffs">likely
      lead to higher inflation</a> and slow economic growth. <a
      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/05/how-trumps-tariffs-rollout-turned-into-stock-market-mayhem.html">Stock
      markets took a major hit</a> already, and JP Morgan raised the <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/markets/jpmorgan-lifts-global-recession-odds-60-us-tariffs-stoke-fears-2025-04-04/">odds
      of a recession to 60%</a>. And this is likely the tip of the iceberg.
    China announced <a
      href="https://www.cnbc.com/2025/04/04/china-to-impose-34percent-retaliatory-tariff-on-all-goods-imported-from-the-us.html">they
      were enacting retaliatory</a> tariffs of 34% on all US products, and so
    far they’re the only ones to do so, but that will change in the coming days
    as more countries are <a
      href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/world/2025/04/04/retaliatory-tariffs-trump-trade/">expected
      to announce their own</a>. Even if all these tariffs are dropped tomorrow,
    the <a href="https://www.thebulwark.com/p/the-american-age-is-over">damage
      to America’s image on the world stage has been done</a>. The USA may have
    lost its status as a reliable and safe trading partner, forever. </p>

  <h2><a id="_sb97hsad6vt5"></a>Why would he do this? </h2>
  <p>Some have speculated this is some <a
      href="https://www.reddit.com/r/Destiny/comments/1jrhj11/trumps_tariffs_arent_about_trade_theyre_about/?utm_source=share&amp;utm_medium=web3x&amp;utm_name=web3xcss&amp;utm_term=1">sort
      of power play</a>, others may try to <a
      href="https://www.newsweek.com/eric-trump-reveals-how-win-tariff-negotiations-dad-2055720">reframe
      these actions as negotiation tactics</a>, but the reality is much simpler
    than that. Trump’s position on tariffs has been arguably the most consistent
    position he’s had. He’s been vocal about this for <a
      href="https://www.msn.com/en-in/news/world/i-d-make-our-allies-pay-trump-s-1988-interview-with-oprah-winfrey-resurfaces-amid-new-tariffs/ar-AA1CfhXs">nearly
      40 years</a>. He wants to <a
      href="https://www.whitehouse.gov/articles/2025/04/support-grows-for-president-trumps-america-first-reciprocal-trade-plan/">bring
      manufacturing</a> jobs back to the US, <a
      href="https://www.nbcnews.com/data-graphics/trump-tariffs-manufacturing-us-business-jobs-economy-rcna199721">but
      a shift like that takes a long time</a>. Economists argue that tariffs <a
      href="https://fortune.com/2025/04/03/trump-tariffs-liberation-day-jobs-promise-economists-disagree-labor-market/">aren’t
      guaranteed</a> to do so, and even if it does the jobs may not be worth the
    pain. Trump’s essentially betting the US economy that he is right, and that
    all the experts are wrong. </p>
  <p>I’ll leave it to u/Zeraphant to get into the speculative portions about
    what happens next but I will note; Despite Peter Navarro, Trump’s top trade
    advisor, explicitly stating that these tariffs were NOT negotiating tactics,
    <a
      href="https://www.forbes.com/sites/siladityaray/2025/04/04/trump-and-advisors-offer-contradictory-takes-on-tariff-negotiations-what-to-know/">Trump
      and others have contradicted</a> this position. He may back out, but
    significant damage has already been done. </p>
