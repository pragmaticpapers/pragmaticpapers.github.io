      The incessant complaining about the “BU-BU-BILLIONAIRES” is misguided,
      politically ineffective, and distracting from achievable and effective
      policy goals.
    </p>

    <p>
      “Billionaires control government” is a sexy idea that seemed to find some
      academic purchase with the 2014 study from Gilens and Page, “<a
        href="https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/perspectives-on-politics/article/testing-theories-of-american-politics-elites-interest-groups-and-average-citizens/62327F513959D0A304D4893B382B992B"
        >Testing Theories of American Politics: Elites, Interest Groups, and
        Average Citizens</a
      >” but

      since have demonstrated, using the same data set from that study, that the
      middle class and the wealthy agree on policy positions almost 90% of the
      time anyway, and where they disagree it’s a coin-toss to see whose policy
      wins out in the end. Despite it being a simple “truism” that the wealthy
      can simply buy elections or pass whatever legislation they desire, a sober
      reading of even recent history would seem to cast much doubt on that
      conclusion.

      What about presidential elections? Hillary Clinton out-raised Trump

      and was crushed in the 2016 election. Harris’ campaign in 2024 raised over

        >a billion dollars</a
      >, crushing Trump’s fundraising efforts, yet still lost. Forbes
      <a href="https://archive.ph/q6rQs">found</a>, funnily enough, that Kamala
      actually had a record number of billionaires supporting her (83 vs 52 for
      Trump), and was even
      <a href="https://archive.ph/nMCdl">supported in an open letter</a>(with
      over a dozen billionaires included in it) by “the wealthy elite.” Even
      among millionaire investors,
      <a href="https://archive.ph/eAEoh">57% supported Harris</a> for the
      election last year.

    <p>
      It would be stupid to say that money (or billionaires) have
      <i>zero</i> impact on politics or election cycles, but you will miss other
      massive drivers of political influence in the United States if you’re
      simply obsessing over who’s backed by the richest constituents.

    <p>
      The progressive agenda is not as popular as progressives online would have
      you believe. Shocking, I know. Electorally, Kamala
      <a href="https://ballotpedia.org/Presidential_election_in_Vermont,_2024"
        >received</a
      >
      over 6,000 more votes in Vermont in 2024 than

        href="https://ballotpedia.org/United_States_Senate_election_in_Vermont,_2024"
        >Bernie Sanders</a
      >. Even the darling “Medicare-for-all” position that progressives will
      insist every single American secretly loves dramatically fluctuates in
      support (<a
        href="https://apnews.com/article/4516833e7fb644c9aa8bcc11048b2169"
        >from 56% down to 26%</a
      >) depending upon how it’s presented to people. And, if the last few
      elections are anything to go by, Americans had no problem voting in record
      numbers for a literal, actual billionaire to become president twice (<a
        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kraken"
        >three times, depending upon who you ask!</a
      >).
    </p>

    <p>
      The policy positions stemming from the anti-billionaire posters are also
      nonsensical. None of the slogans even make sense. “Billionaires need to
      pay their fair share!” What does that even mean? The top 1 percent earners
      in the country pay an average individual income tax rate of 24% while the
      21st–40th percentile of earners have a negative tax-rate (<a
        href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-do-marginal-income-tax-rates-work-and-what-if-we-increased-them/"
        >in 2016</a
      >). As of 2024, US billionaires have a
      <a
        href="https://ips-dc.org/total-u-s-billionaire-wealth-up-88-over-four-years/"
        >combined net worth of $5.529 trillion</a
      >. If we took every single asset they had (assuming we could do this
      legally), sold all of them (assuming we could do this without destroying
      the stock market price of the assets we’re selling), and then applied it
      to our US Debt, we could pay off about 15% of what’s
      <a href="https://www.usdebtclock.org/">owed</a>.
    </p>

    <p>
      It also pushes people towards unpopular or ineffective policies. Even
      Kamala Harris was pushing for some form of wealth tax, a position that’s
      been popular amongst the “billionaire hater” crowd. The problem is, wealth
      taxes
      <a
        href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/what-is-a-wealth-tax-and-should-the-united-states-have-one/"
        >kind of suck</a
      >, for a variety of reasons. They’re difficult to administer, can lead to
      a massive exit of capital, and don’t ultimately end up raising that much
      revenue for the government. In 1994, 12 nations in the OECD had wealth
      taxes, but by the end of 2022, all but 4 had dropped them. If we really
      wanted to increase our revenues, we should broaden our tax base (<a
        href="https://www.pgpf.org/article/how-do-marginal-income-tax-rates-work-and-what-if-we-increased-them/"
        >like most European countries do</a
      >) and fully empower the IRS to go after the hundreds of billions of
      dollars every single year that aren’t being
      <a href="https://www.irs.gov/pub/irs-pdf/p5869.pdf">appropriately paid</a
      >.
    </p>

    <p>
      Fixating on actual policies gives us a real position to rally around,
      allows us to mobilize around effective positions that would make a real
      change, and make it harder for politicians to ignore us when we make
      demands of them in elections. We need less retweetable slogans and more
      effective policy if we want to practice effective political power in the
      future.
