  <h2><a id="_q8ogl9rc85ov"></a><strong>The Stage Is Yours</strong></h2>
  <p><em>How Nayib Bukele turned a country into an audience</em></p>
  <h3><a id="_dy3jux2qwmxo"></a><strong>Institutional Gutting and the Shadow
      Court</strong></h3>
  <p>Nayib Bukele assumed the presidency in 2019 as a self-styled political
    outsider, but within weeks it became clear that his outsider status would
    not translate into humility. Almost immediately, he clashed with the
    Legislative Assembly, going so far as to storm the chamber in February 2020
    with armed soldiers in an attempt to pressure lawmakers into approving a
    security loan. The display was blatantly militaristic and broadcast live to
    El Salvador, making it clear to the public what was to come. This stunt was
    condemned both domestically and abroad, but Bukele remained unapologetic. He
    prayed theatrically from the president’s chair and later claimed divine
    sanction for his actions. It was a warning shot, not just to legislators but
    to the democratic framework itself. The executive is no longer bound by
    decorum or constraint.</p>
  <p>The full scope of that message became evident in 2021, when his party,
    Nuevas Ideas, secured a supermajority in the Legislative Assembly. With
    unchecked legislative control, Bukele wasted no time dismantling the
    country’s institutional independence. Within <em>hours </em>of his party’s
    victory, the Assembly voted to remove the five magistrates of the
    Constitutional Chamber of the Supreme Court and the Attorney General. No
    credible investigation or constitutional process preceded the purge.
    Replacements were rushed in, many with direct affiliations to the executive,
    including former legal advisors and political allies. The court that had
    once ruled consecutive presidential terms unconstitutional now reversed that
    very decision, conveniently clearing the way for Bukele to seek reelection
    in 2024. Bukele packed the courts, and rewrote the constitution for his own
    vainglorious quest for ultimate power. No wonder he and Trump are such close
    friends.</p>
  <p>The Attorney General’s removal followed the same pattern. The newly
    installed official suspended investigations into high-profile corruption
    cases implicating the administration, while ramping up cases against
    critics, opposition leaders, and journalists. Institutions once designed to
    serve as democratic guardrails became tools of political utility, offering
    legal cover for the consolidation of power. As watchdogs were silenced,
    Bukele began to intensify his grip. His government increasingly relied on
    secrecy, executive decrees, and weaponized legalism, hollowing out the
    already fragile rule of law. By the end of his first term, Bukele had
    repurposed them; stagecraft in his broader performance of unchallengeable
    authority. And half of America loves the show.</p>
  <h3><a id="_89sa7i9bdr93"></a><strong>State of Exception: Arbitrary Arrests
      Under the Guise of Safety</strong></h3>
  <p>In March 2022, following a surge in gang-related homicides that left over
    80 dead in a single weekend, Nayib Bukele’s government declared a national
    “state of exception.” On paper, it was a temporary constitutional suspension
    meant to stem the violence. In practice, it opened the door to mass
    arbitrary arrests, warrantless searches, and indefinite detention without
    trial. Key rights such as freedom of association, the right to legal
    counsel, and the presumption of innocence were effectively nullified
    overnight. The Salvadoran military deployed alongside police, patrolling
    streets, conducting raids, and detaining anyone suspected of gang
    affiliation. “Suspicion” was often based on vague and superficial markers:
    youth, tattoos, a prior address in a high-crime area, or simply the wrong
    look at the wrong time.</p>
  <p>Within the first twelve months, over 65,000 Salvadorans, (more than 1% of
    the country’s population) had been detained. Many were never formally
    charged. Among them are the Niños de Chalatenango. They were a group of 10
    minors, ranging from 12 to 17, arrested for appearing in a 10 second video.
    The kids were hanging out in the video, most unaware they were being filmed,
    and one signaled to the camera. The video was sent in a whatsapp chat
    accidentally, but was then deleted. However, someone managed to download the
    video, edited in music associated with gang activity, and the boys were
    arrested. In another case, police arrested a 45 year old taxi owner at his
    shop in San Salvador. Officers forced him to kneel on the ground for about
    two hours in the hot sun and forced him to squat 25 times while naked.
    “Welcome to hell,” prison guards allegedly said.</p>

    Limus/BBC)</p>
  <p>Human rights organizations, both domestic and international, have
    documented hundreds of cases of abuse. People tortured during interrogation,
    denied access to lawyers, or crammed into overcrowded prisons without
    charges. In some instances, detainees were held incommunicado for weeks,
    their families only learning of their status through lists posted outside
    detention centers. Several have died behind bars, their bodies returned with
    signs of trauma. Yet despite the cruelty, the Salvadoran public remains
    firmly supportive. Polls show Bukele's approval ratings soaring above 80%,
    with the majority of respondents claiming to feel safer. In a country
    traumatized by decades of gang extortion and impunity, even those who know
    someone wrongly imprisoned still back the policy. Fear has proven more
    durable than empathy.</p>
  <p>This dissonance is not unique to El Salvador. In the United States, the
    Trump administration employs similar rhetorical tools. They cast immigrants
    as criminals, depict cities as lawless, and elevate “law and order” above
    civil liberties. Even now, Trump uses these tried and true excuses to
    justify sending the national guard to California, and painting the protests
    there as extreme riots. Trump praises police who rough up suspects, labels
    judicial oversight as weakness, and flirts openly with the idea of
    suspending norms when politically convenient. While the U.S. possesses
    stronger institutional guardrails, the authoritarian impulse is not
    exclusive to one nation. Bukele’s state of exception is simply a more
    concentrated version of a playbook visible across democratic backslides
    worldwide.</p>
  <p>The danger lies not just in the suspension of rights but in the
    normalization of their absence. By framing civil liberties as luxuries
    afforded only in times of peace, Bukele has redefined the legal baseline of
    governance. The longer the state of exception endures, (extended monthly by
    a corrupt legislature) the harder it becomes to remember what ordinary law
    looked like. What began as a response to the crisis is now the new status
    quo. And as mass imprisonment is celebrated as victory, the distinction
    between order and oppression collapses. In this framework, justice is not
    blind, but deferential. </p>
  <h3><a id="_pcjgc551l93k"></a><strong>The CECOT Spectacle: Prison as Political
      Theater</strong></h3>
  <p>In early 2023, Nayib Bukele unveiled his most grotesque symbol of
    authoritarian pride: the <strong>Centro de Confinamiento del
      Terrorismo</strong> (CECOT), a mega prison built to house 40,000 alleged
    gang members. Announced with dramatic flair and presented as the ultimate
    solution to decades of insecurity, CECOT was constructed in under seven
    months on a remote stretch of land in Tecoluca, San Vicente. Surveillance
    drones buzz overhead. Guard towers loom over concrete perimeters laced with
    barbed wire. Military barracks line the entrance. The message was
    unmistakable: this is not a rehabilitation center. It is a holding pen
    designed to inspire fear.</p>
  <p>Inside, conditions resemble a carceral dystopia. Inmates are packed
    shoulder-to-shoulder in concrete cells, often without beds or access to
    daylight. Sanitation is minimal. Water is rationed. There is no contact with
    families or legal counsel. Prisoners are shaved bald, forced to squat in
    rows, and marched barefoot in chains. These are images that Bukele’s
    government proudly disseminates on official channels, a practice eerily
    similar to the public throwing rotten fruit at people in stockades. The
    prison has no outdoor recreation area, no rehabilitative programming, and
    virtually no medical infrastructure. Human rights monitors have been barred
    entry, and court access is functionally nonexistent. For most detainees, the
    presumption is not guilt or innocence, it is invisibility. Once inside
    CECOT, a person simply disappears.</p>
  <p>CECOT is more than a prison. It is a monument to the spectacle of state
    violence. Its launch was accompanied by dramatic footage of the first 2,000
    inmates being transferred in the dead of night, shirtless and shackled,
    heads down and hands behind their backs. The images went viral. They were
    not meant for domestic reassurance alone, but for international admiration.
    In February 2024, Donald Trump praised Bukele’s prison in a Truth Social
    post, declaring he would like to send American “MS-13 thugs” there,
    describing it as “the kind of strength we need.” The suggestion was absurd
    and legally incoherent, but it underscored something real: CECOT is less a
    correctional facility than a global avatar of punitive power, fetishized by
    authoritarians and hardliners as a fantasy of zero-tolerance governance. It
    is a place designed not only to hold bodies, but to project dominance.</p>

    Salvador presidential press office via AP</p>
  <p>What makes CECOT particularly chilling is not just its cruelty, but its
    popularity. Polls suggest Salvadorans overwhelmingly support its existence.
    For many, the prison stands as proof that the government is finally doing
    something. The pain of incarceration is someone else’s problem, until it
    isn’t. By mid-2024, families of inmates had formed quiet support networks,
    sharing stories of relatives who vanished into the system for minor offenses
    or none at all. Several former detainees, later released without charges,
    described brutal beatings and psychological torture. But dissent remains
    muted. To question CECOT is to appear soft on crime. In this atmosphere, due
    process becomes a liability, and the prison a totem of national pride. </p>
  <h3><a id="_k2ikp2to2yz1"></a><strong>Media Blackouts and “Foreign Agents”
      Laws</strong></h3>
  <p>From the earliest months of his presidency, Nayib Bukele made it clear that
    independent journalism would not be tolerated as a check on power. Framing
    the press as an enemy of progress, he adopted a familiar strategy:
    delegitimize critics, amplify loyalists, and weaponize state power to
    silence dissenting voices. On Twitter he often accused journalists of being
    “paid by foreign interests,” “propaganda machines,” or worse, “accomplices
    to gangs.” What began as rhetorical skirmishes soon hardened into a campaign
    of repression. Independent newsrooms were surveilled, raided, and smeared.
    Reporters were harassed online and in person, and investigative journalism
    became not just inconvenient, but dangerous.</p>
  <p>One of the clearest cases of intimidation was the targeting of <em>El
      Faro</em>, El Salvador’s leading investigative outlet. In 2020, Bukele
    publicly accused <em>El Faro</em> of money laundering without evidence. The
    next year, the government launched a financial audit of the paper, spanning
    more than a decade of transactions—a move widely condemned as politically
    motivated. In 2022, it was revealed that Pegasus spyware, sold only to
    governments, had been covertly installed on the phones of more than
    twenty-five <em>El Faro</em> journalists. The spyware granted access to
    their cameras, microphones, and private communications. Rather than deny
    involvement, Bukele’s administration refused to comment. Surely though, they
    would’ve mumbled something about gangs and security for their cheap excuses.
  </p>
  <p>Other newsrooms met similar fates. <em>Revista Factum</em> reported being
    followed and harassed by security agents. Anonymous Telegram channels with
    ties to Nuevas Ideas began leaking private information about reporters’
    families. The Association of Journalists of El Salvador (APES) documented a
    sharp rise in threats, digital surveillance, and physical aggression against
    the press. Meanwhile, Bukele expanded the role of state media, flooding the
    digital space with stylized propaganda pieces glorifying his leadership.
    Those sympathetic to the government were granted exclusive access. Those
    critical were blocked from press briefings or had their accreditation
    revoked, chillingly echoing the AP’s ban from the White House newsroom over
    their coverage of the Gulf of Mexico. Over time, Bukele transformed the
    information landscape into a stage-managed performance where only approved
    narratives could breathe.</p>
  <p>The parallels to Donald Trump’s media war are not coincidental. Like Trump,
    Bukele painted the press as corrupt and unpatriotic, casting inconvenient
    stories as “fake news” and journalists as political operatives. Trump’s
    “enemy of the people” rhetoric emboldened his base to view criticism as
    treason; Bukele’s followers operate on the same logic. Both men understood
    that control over media narratives is as crucial as control over
    institutions. But Bukele has gone further. Where Trump was often stymied by
    courts or norms, Bukele dismantled those norms entirely. It wasn’t just
    demonizing independent media. He surveilled it, criminalized it, and sought
    to eliminate its very infrastructure. What Trump gestured toward, Bukele
    realized with clinical efficiency.</p>
  <p>In Bukele’s El Salvador, the erosion of press freedom is foundational to
    his regime. Without a vibrant press, state abuses go unrecorded, opposition
    voices are muted, and the public is fed a steady diet of triumphalist
    fiction. This blackout is not just literal, it is epistemological. Truth
    itself becomes subject to executive approval. And as Bukele eyes reelection
    under a constitutional interpretation engineered by his own judges, the
    silencing of the press is not just about narrative control. It is about
    eliminating the last remaining threat to total power: accountability.</p>
  <h3><a id="_widh6esn9jcg"></a><strong>Gang Deals and U.S. Complicity</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>While Nayib Bukele rose to power denouncing the gangs as domestic
    terrorists and vowing their total eradication, the public crackdown masked a
    secret alliance beneath the surface. Beginning as early as 2019, mere months
    into his Presidency, evidence emerged suggesting Bukele’s administration had
    entered into covert negotiations with MS-13 and Barrio 18, the very groups
    he was publicly condemning. These negotiations were not small-scale
    backchannels; they involved top-level figures in his administration meeting
    with gang leaders inside prison facilities. In exchange for reduced homicide
    rates, better prison conditions, and the transfer of certain inmates to more
    lenient facilities, the gangs allegedly agreed to a “truce”, not unlike
    those struck by Bukele’s predecessors, which he had once condemned as
    morally bankrupt.</p>
  <p>Journalistic investigations by <em>El Faro</em> and others revealed that
    government officials facilitated the talks through the prison system’s
    directorate, with meetings occurring in facilities like Zacatecoluca and
    Izalco. The inmates were rewarded not just with amenities, some of which
    were televisions, cell phones, and access to conjugal visits, but with the
    kind of informal political power that made prison walls permeable. When
    these stories first surfaced in 2020, Bukele responded not with denial but
    with fury against the press. His administration accused <em>El Faro</em> of
    fabricating evidence and launched audits and tax probes against its
    journalists. Meanwhile, internal government documents and visitor logs from
    the prison authority began quietly disappearing. The Attorney General’s
    office, which had been actively investigating the allegations, was abruptly
    gutted in 2021 when Bukele’s newly installed supermajority in the
    Legislative Assembly removed Attorney General Raúl Melara and replaced him
    with a loyalist. The investigation was promptly buried.</p>
  <p>This was more than just political maneuvering. It was a coordinated
    suppression of accountability at every level: legislative, judicial, and
    informational. In the same year Bukele began rounding up tens of thousands
    under the state of exception, he was still benefiting from the gang pacts
    that had artificially lowered the homicide rate in his first two years. The
    deal had bought him breathing room. It was time to consolidate control,
    purge institutions, and stage-manage the narrative of transformation. The
    gangs were no longer just enemies of the state; they were unwitting
    collaborators in the creation of a myth. Their existence justified
    repression, while their compliance enabled calm. Bukele’s promise to
    eliminate gangs, then, was never about principle. It was simply a stage
    prop, to be bargained with in private, then to be publicly sacrificed for
    applause.</p>
  <p>The hypocrisy is stark. The man who railed against previous administrations
    for "negotiating with killers" did exactly that, only more secretly, and
    with greater impunity. While opposition figures faced criminal charges for
    earlier pacts, Bukele rewrote the script so that his own arrangement could
    masquerade as victory. In doing so, he created a dangerous precedent: that
    state legitimacy can be traded for optics, and that justice is secondary to
    control. The result is a regime that punishes the powerless with sweeping
    arrests while rewarding the powerful behind closed doors. It is not that
    Bukele found a new way to solve the gang crisis. It is that he found a more
    sophisticated way to exploit it. He is managing to turn fear into fuel, and
    silence into obedience.</p>
  <h3><a id="_1qiuhf91zmxu"></a><strong>Performance, Not Partnership</strong>
  </h3>
  <p>Since taking office in 2019, Bukele has not governed El Salvador so much as
    he has branded it. He has treated foreign relations as little more than a
    backdrop against which to stage his own myth. Whether hosting U.S. diplomats
    or addressing the United Nations, he rarely speaks in terms of shared goals
    or regional solidarity. Instead, he delivers slogans about sovereignty,
    strength, and the right to do things “the Salvadoran way.” He mocks the
    international press, belittles critics from human rights organizations, and
    accuses foreign governments of hypocrisy, all while cultivating an image of
    principled defiance. In truth, there is little principle in Bukele’s foreign
    posture, only the reflexive defense of spectacle.</p>

  <p>When Joe Biden’s administration voiced concerns over El Salvador’s
    democratic backsliding, Bukele replied not with policy, but with memes. When
    the U.S. Treasury sanctioned close aides for corruption and gang
    negotiations, Bukele dismissed the evidence as politically motivated. His
    administration grew closer to China, not from any coherent ideological
    realignment, but from transactional convenience. He promised to “decouple”
    from Western dependence while refusing to disclose the terms of his dealings
    with Beijing. Meanwhile, foreign investment remains cautious, and
    international watchdogs continue to warn of creeping authoritarianism. But
    none of that matters for Bukele’s purposes. He isn’t interested in
    diplomacy, he is interested in one thing: Branding.</p>
  <p>And through that, Bukele managed to find the admirer who matters more than
    any trade deal or human rights resolution: Donald Trump. Since 2020, the two
    have engaged in a kind of transnational feedback loop. Bukele borrowed
    Trump’s rhetoric of fake news, his disdain for institutions, and his
    self-portrait as an outsider savior. Trump, in turn, has praised Bukele’s
    prison policies, his crackdown on crime, and his “toughness.” In early 2024,
    Trump said he wanted to send gang members in the U.S. to Bukele’s
    megaprison, CECOT. That the comment was legally absurd didn’t matter. It was
    symbolic. It signaled something deeper: that Bukele’s El Salvador is no
    longer just a country,it is a blueprint, a testbed for autocratic techniques
    wrapped in populist charisma. A sandbox for strongmen-in-waiting.</p>
  <p>What Bukele has constructed is a political model that requires constant
    escalation. Repression must intensify to maintain the illusion of order.
    Dissent must shrink to sustain the image of unity. The myth of
    incorruptibility must grow even as corruption deepens. Each crackdown
    requires another, each spectacle demands a bigger one. And as Trump eyes
    another presidential term, he is watching not only how Bukele governs, but
    how he gets away with it. If El Salvador is the lab, the United States may
    be next in line for the experiment.</p>
  <p>Bukele has not brought peace to El Salvador. He has brought quiet and
    called it peace. The question is not whether the silence will last. The
    question is what it will cost to keep it.</p>
