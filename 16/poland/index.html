  <h2><a id="_yuha73qwesq4"></a><strong>The election</strong></h2>
  <p>On June 1st, Karol Tadeusz Nawrocki won the Polish presidential election by
    a razor-thin margin, securing a majority of 50.89 %, narrowly defeating the
    moderate Rafał Trzaskowski.</p>
  <p>This victory comes at a time when Poland’s economy continues to grow
    robustly, with a GDP per capita now comparable to Spain’s and projected to
    compete with the wealthiest EU nations within the next decade. However,
    since 2016, corruption in Poland has notably increased, driven by weakened
    judicial independence, expanded political control over state institutions,
    and misuse of public funds benefiting party-linked media and cronies, all
    developments occurring under the previous hard-line nationalist president,
    Andrzej Duda.</p>
  <p>Consequently, many within the European community had hoped for a
    stabilising figure. With Poland’s prime minister being a committed
    Europhile, a similarly pro-EU president would have likely drawn Poland
    closer to Brussels during a critical juncture for European unity. It was not
    to be.</p>
  <p>Although the president does not directly craft legislation, the office
    holds considerable veto power, potentially rendering ineffective any
    government and prime minister with whom the president disagrees.</p>
  <p>In order to forecast the trajectory of Poland, a country of huge
    geographical and economical significance to the EU, and more widely Europe,
    one must ask: who is Karol Nawrocki?</p>
  <h2><a id="_ghyhv0vc1dlx"></a><strong>Childhood and studies</strong></h2>
  <p>Karol Nawrocki is Poland’s first millennial president, born at the tail end
    of communist rule in 1983 in Gdańsk. His father actively opposed communism,
    sowing the seed for the anti-communist zeal that is fundamental in
    understanding his mentality.</p>
  <p>It cannot be understated what perspective he would have had on the downfall
    of communism, with Gdańsk the birthplace of Solidarity, the movement that
    rose up against the dictatorship. Moreover, it was at the dockyards that the
    movement garnered substantial support, with Karol’s father, a dockyard
    worker, himself joining the organisation. Thus, as an impressionable boy he
    was given front-row seats to the overthrow of communism.</p>
  <p>Though it can be assumed that Catholicism was in the background of his
    childhood, with this being typical of the region, little is said of this as
    a defining feature.</p>
  <p>Growing up in the 1990s Karol’s father went to the UK in order to find
    work, exemplifying the work ethic with which he identifies. As a keen
    sportsman Karol was known for his skills as a footballer and boxer, boxing
    competitively from 2000-2004.</p>
  <p>Student-era publications by Nawrocki in the conservative monthly <em>Arcana
    </em>praised Poland’s NATO accession. He has since repeatedly signaled his
    support and belief in NATO. Despite having completed a bachelor’s degree in
    personnel-administration his attention was drawn towards the study of
    history, completing a doctorate with a thesis titled "Social Resistance to
    Communist Rule in the Elbląg Voivodeship, 1976-1989". He demonstrated an eye
    for historical accuracy, utilising mostly primary sources as the basis for
    his argumentation.</p>
  <h2><a id="_nf8yj6i8lnq5"></a><strong>A hunger for violence</strong></h2>
  <p>Karol’s love of fighting didn’t remain in the ring. He has himself admitted
    involvement in pre-planned illegal street brawls between football gangs. In
    May 2025, Nawrocki publicly acknowledged taking part in a “70 vs. 70”
    arranged fight—a pre-planned street brawl typical of football hooligan
    culture between supporters of Lechia Gdańsk and Lech Poznań in 2009,
    describing it as a “sporting, noble fight among men.” Despite not being
    himself arrested, others involved in the violence were.</p>

  <p>Despite only admitting to this single case, it is highly probable that he
    was ingrained into the culture, with him having the nickname “Doctor
    Knockout” suggesting regular involvement. Lechia’s culture has
    systematically far-right nationalist beliefs with strongly held xenophobic
    positions. At matches, various banners exemplify direct anti-EU, nationalist
    sentiment. Arguably this involvement in extremist culture is more
    significant than the violence itself.</p>
  <p>There is also a stronger tie with religion among the scene’s culture than
    has been spoken of from his childhood suggesting this was defining of his
    movement towards becoming a more devout catholic. Lechia ultras frequently
    invoked God, honour, and nation. All these aspects of Karol’s current
    beliefs, honed into a polite narrative for the electorate, demonstrate how
    he was shaped by being embedded in the football hooligan culture.</p>
  <h2><a id="_ukkxnvbjfj8z"></a><strong>Work experience: Institute of National
      Remembrance and Museum of the Second World War</strong></h2>
  <p>Karol Nawrocki rose swiftly within Poland’s grouping of nationalist memory
    institutions. Appointed director of the Museum of the Second World War in
    Gdańsk in April 2017, after the Ministry of Culture abruptly dismissed the
    founding team, he immediately signalled that the permanent exhibition would
    be "realigned" to foreground Polish heroism [1]. An overhaul followed.
    Panels on the Jedwabne pogrom, the Blue Police, and civilian complicity were
    either excised or relegated to footnotes, while new displays celebrated the
    Polish Underground State, Catholic resistance, and the post-war
    anti-communist insurgency. Critics inside the museum were moved to
    back-office roles, contracts with outside scholars were terminated, and the
    advisory board was reshaped around historians close to the ruling Law and
    Justice (PiS) party. Under Nawrocki the institution pivoted from reflective
    history centre to patriotic outreach hub, launching TikTok-friendly
    campaigns such as <em>PolskaWalcząca</em> and a travelling exhibit,
    <em>Trail of Polish Victories</em>, that toured provincial schools in 2020.
    Effectively the exhibits became a form of propaganda.</p>
  <p>In July 2021 the government promoted him to President of the Institute of
    National Remembrance (IPN), entrusting him with both archival stewardship
    and prosecutorial powers under the 2016 “decommunization” law. Within
    eighteen months more than one hundred Soviet-era monuments were dismantled
    or hauled away, prompting the Russian Investigative Committee to issue a
    warrant for his arrest—a first for any Polish official since 1989.</p>
  <p>Meanwhile grants for Holocaust research were trimmed, while new
    investigative resources flowed toward cases of communist-era abuses.</p>
  <p>Taken together, Nawrocki’s record shows a consistent pattern, harnessing
    cultural institutions to write an unambiguous narrative of Polish heroics
    and moral singularity, even at the cost of scholarly pluralism and
    diplomatic friction. It is often not what is said but what isn’t.</p>
  <h2><a id="_12t1vqkiw67"></a><strong>The election campaign 2024-25</strong>
  </h2>
  <p>Nawrocki’s campaign weaponised culture wars and Euroscepticism. He promised
    a unilateral exit from the EU Migration Pact ("I will terminate the EU’s
    migration pact") [2]. In a staged cultural performance, he shredded a copy
    of <em>Gender Queer </em>on camera—a symbolic act reflecting deep-seated
    social conservatism [3]. He framed the election as a “referendum on liberal
    Brussels policy,” directly casting Brussels as the enemy [4].</p>
  <p>A second line of attack centred on Ukraine’s wartime aspirations. In a
    televised interview on 8 January 2025 he argued that Kyiv must “answer for
    the brutal crime against 120 000 Poles in Volhynia” before joining either
    the EU or NATO, adding that “a state unable to settle its historical
    accounts cannot claim the privileges of full European membership.” [5]
    Kyiv’s foreign ministry condemned the remark as “biased and manipulative,”
    but the episode signalled how Nawrocki is prepared to fuse memory politics
    with foreign-policy leverage, keeping both Brussels and Kyiv guessing how
    far he might go once in office. In other instances Nawrocki has suggested
    that there is no path to membership of either organisation, showing how
    elusive his actual position can be.</p>
  <h2><a id="_r1g6abcm6rx9"></a><strong>Resentment towards Ukraine and telling
      tweets</strong></h2>
  <p>Although Nawrocki’s polished social-media persona emphasises diplomacy,
    subtle signals reveal a deeper agenda and manipulative character. Here are
    some examples of Nawrocki’s underlying politics through his use of Twitter,
    including with members of the Romanian far- right with genuine neo-Nazi
    tendencies, Ukraine-scepticism and ambiguity, and other signals of political
    posturing.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2019-05-11: </strong>Criticism of opponents to the Westerplatte
      Museum project on X: <em>“Solidarity against the construction of the
        Museum on Westerplatte. You should meet under this slogan. @mask Why
        didn’t you build the Westerplatte Museum when you had all the tools and
        budget (prime minister, president, city president, voivodeship marshal,
        voivode, director of the Museum of the Second World War)?”</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This pointed remark reflects a deep alignment with the nationalist
    narrative promoted by the ruling Law and Justice party (PiS). The quote
    suggests a readiness to dismiss critics as politically or ideologically
    motivated and frames opposition to state-directed historical projects as
    unpatriotic. Clearly he has little tolerance for dissenting perspectives in
    public commemorations. The nationalist narrative wishes to deny the
    importance of Polish collaborators with the Nazis, including in the
    Holocaust, putting pressure on museums to shy away from historical accuracy.
  </p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2025-04-03: </strong>Campaign message on migration on X:
      <em>“Poland is being flooded with illegal migrants being smuggled to us
        from Germany. We must stop this immediately. On 18 May, let’s choose our
        safe future. I will be its guarantor!” </em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Likely referring to migrants who were returned to Poland from Germany. Far
    from a flood, this is orders of magnitude less than that coming across
    either the Ukraine or Belarus border. No tweets appear discussing the
    Belarus problem. This is suggestive of finding an excuse to have friction
    with Germany to suit a Eurosceptic agenda.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2025-04-29: </strong>Romanian hard-line nationalist leader
      George Simion posted from Bucharest on X: <em>“Great to welcome today in
        Bucharest @mblaszczak and @JKowalski_business — Greetings from
        Poland!”</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>Simion travelled to Poland to appear at a Nawrocki campaign rally in
    Zabrze, signalling</p>
  <p>cross-border nationalist collaboration.</p>
  <p><em>Background on Simion: </em>Founder of the far-right Alliance for the
    Union of Romanians (AUR). Rose to prominence through the Action 2012
    movement for Romanian-Moldovan unification. Opposes same-sex marriage, Covid
    restrictions, mandatory vaccination, and deeper EU integration, somewhat
    ideologically aligned with Giorgia Meloni, Donald Trump, and Poland’s PiS,
    though he has questioned the Romani community’s place in Romania,
    exemplifying extremes of xenophobia. There are multiple examples of strong
    Simion–Nawrocki relations.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2025-06-03: </strong>On X, Nawrocki thanked Ukrainian President
      Volodymyr Zelenskyy: <em>“Dear President @ZelenskyyUa, thank you for your
        message. I am looking forward to continue partnership of our countries.
        . . </em>” The cordial tone contrasts with his resistance to deeper
      political union.</li>
    <li><strong>2025-06-07 </strong>However, in his first foreign-language
      interview (Hungarian weekly Mandiner) Nawrocki declared: <em>“I am against
        Ukraine’s entry into the European Union. . . Ukraine must understand
        that other countries, including Poland, Hungary and other European
        countries, also have their own interests.”</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>He praised Viktor Orbán as “a very effective politician” and said
    Polish-Hungarian co- operation is “essential for the growth and security of
    the region.” Only Hungary and Slovakia are so staunchly opposed to Ukraine
    joining the EU. Orbán is infamous for stalling support getting to Ukraine.
    Interestingly, in other tweets he hinted to the Serbian prime minister at
    Serbia’s future membership despite the suppression of the press in Serbia,
    suggesting pro-Serbia/anti-Ukraine bias.</p>
  <ul>
    <li><strong>2025-01-08: </strong><em>“Today, I do not see Ukraine in any
        structure — neither in the European Union nor in NATO — until important.
        . . issues for Poles are resolved. A country that cannot answer for a
        very brutal crime against 120 000 of its neighbours cannot be part of
        international alliances.”</em></li>
  </ul>
  <p>This quote may suggest the motivation behind Nawrocki’s apparent resentment
    towards Ukraine. Despite the numbers of victims being disputed, the intent
    to ethnically cleanse by Ukrainian nationalists is not debated by historians
    which defines the Volhynia Massacre. Nevertheless, resentment driven by
    historical events doesn’t suggest a promising discourse in light of Ukraine
    recognising the massacre.</p>
  <p>These communications underscore a dual strategy: publicly affirm alliances,
    but subtly propagate nationalist, exclusionary attitudes cloaked in
    diplomatic language. Nawrocki clearly understands the importance of optics.
  </p>
  <h2><a id="_7rewec8is481"></a><strong>How Nawrocki May Shape the
      Presidency</strong></h2>
  <p>Based on the aforementioned history, we can estimate the direction of
    governance. There are clear similarities with Viktor Orbán of Hungary,
    though Nawrocki has been consistently anti-Russia, a stance rooted in his
    upbringing. To add to this, it should be mentioned that Nawrocki tweeted on
    February 25th, 2022 passionate support for Ukraine’s fight for survival.
    Orban’s position was comparably tepid.</p>
  <p>Alas, it shouldn’t be forgotten that Orbán himself was at some point
    substantially Russia-sceptic, though there is little basis to suggest that
    Nawrocki is capable of changing his stance eastwards quite in the way that
    Orbán did.</p>
  <p>As such, a better comparison may be with Giorgia Meloni, prime minister of
    Italy. Despite her Euroscepticism and an appeal to nationalism she has been
    a supporter of Ukraine and has developed a rapport with various EU leaders.
    This is in stark contrast with Orbán, who remains mostly isolated among EU
    leaders.</p>

    Theatre in Warsaw, Poland, on June 1, 2025.WOJTEK RADWANSKI/AFP via Getty
    Images</p>
  <p>One key difference between Meloni and Nawrocki, which pushes him back
    toward the Orbán position, is that Meloni has suggested a NATO Article
    5-like defence of Ukraine, whilst Nawrocki has rarely shown compromise to
    his position that Ukraine should not be a NATO member. Hence, though he may
    appear closer to Meloni’s position, he is nevertheless somewhere between the
    Meloni-Orbán extrema of European hard-line nationalists when it comes to
    Ukraine.</p>
  <p>While military aid to Ukraine may continue, political opposition to
    Ukraine’s EU/NATO membership will persist, straining Warsaw-Kyiv relations.
  </p>
  <p>In Europe, friction with Brussels is likely, as Nawrocki consolidates his
    role as a Visegrád-style sovereign nationalist. We can expect frequent use
    of veto power to stall pro-EU reforms on the judiciary, climate policy, and
    migration, jeopardising his own government’s ability to legislate until the
    likely replacement of Donald Tusk, the prime minister. Tusk survived a vote
    of confidence on June 11th, 2025 and thus is likely to be in situ for the
    foreseeable future.</p>
  <p>Nawrocki will continue culture-war tactics, legislating against abortion
    rights, banning LGBTQ protections, and promoting Christian symbols in public
    life-to mobilise his social base at the expense of liberal pluralism [7].
  </p>
  <p>Additionally, he will strengthen institutions like IPN to reinforce a
    nationalist historical narrative. He has already downplayed Poland’s role in
    Holocaust memory, and as president he’s likely to suppress acknowledgement
    of Polish complicity under the guise of defending national dignity [8]. If a
    future Polish government aligns with Nawrocki and pushes through
    undemocratic reforms it should be expected that EU funds will be withheld.
    This could push him towards Orbán.</p>
  <p>Despite Nawrocki’s average reputation as an orator, he demonstrates a sharp
    eye for optics and sloganeering. Nawrocki’s social media presence shows
    ignorance of the modern media landscape. How far he will go in pursuit of
    his hard-line nationalist agenda is difficult to gauge. He appears capable
    of packaging extremist views in palatable forms for media consumption.</p>
  <p>If a government broadly sympathetic to him takes shape, Poland could become
    an unpredictable veto-player, willing to trade support for EU budgets or
    Ukraine aid against concessions on migration, cultural policy, or Brussels’
    rule-of-law mechanisms. None of those levers guarantees success, but the
    mere readiness to pull them would inject fresh uncertainty into both the EU
    project and Kyiv’s war-time calculus, forcing partners to weigh every deal
    against the possibility of Warsaw’s ability to blackmail.</p>
  <p>Whether the European project can survive multiple actors with these
    disingenuous intentions has yet to be seen.</p>
