  <p>South Korea held early elections on June 3rd, 2025, in order to determine
    who would be the next president. 6 months after the impeachment of then
    sitting president Yoon Suk Yeol, let’s take a look at how things have
    changed, and how the future might look for one of the US's closest allies.
  </p>
  <p><strong>On December 3rd, 2024</strong> at 22:27 Korea Standard Time, Yoon
    Suk Yeol addressed the nation in a televised address. "To safeguard a
    liberal South Korea from the threats posed by North Korea's communist forces
    and to eliminate anti-state elements . . . I hereby declare emergency
    martial law," Yoon said. The invocation of martial law prohibits political
    activities, such as the gathering of the National Assembly and local
    legislatures. It also suspends the freedom of the press. Separately, Yoon
    ordered the arrest of various political officials including those from the
    Democratic Party (DPK, his main opposition) and the People Power Party (PPP,
    his own party). Luckily, <a
      href="https://www.ft.com/content/f67a0208-1b03-4bd2-a5e7-7831f8cde292">the
      military was not all-in on the plan</a>, and thus; the self-coup was
    short-lived. Less than 3 hours later 190 legislators unanimously passed a
    motion lifting martial law, and martial law was lifted by Yoon himself at
    4:30 am KST, 6 hours after the declaration. </p>

  <p></p>
  <p><strong>Why did Yoon declare martial law?</strong> </p>
  <p>In order to understand this, you have to understand the political climate
    in South Korea, which if you’re American may not be too difficult. When Yoon
    won the presidency in 2022, he did so by a margin of less than 1%, barely
    beating out Lee Jae-Myung of the DPK for the spot. This election was
    irrefutable evidence that the country was deeply polarized, with both sides
    viewing each other as “<a
      href="https://www.asiapacific.ca/publication/explainer-yoons-failed-martial-law-decree-future-impacts">mortal
      enemies</a>” according to some experts. Despite the presidential victory,
    Yoon and the PPP were still the minority legislative party and faced an
    uphill battle enacting any policy. What little they could do resulted in a
    <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2024%E2%80%932025_South_Korean_medical_crisis">healthcare
      crisis</a>, which coupled with various <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-68090638">political scandals</a>
    (<a
      href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/southkorea/politics/20240105/dpk-accuses-yoon-of-abusing-veto-power">including
      Yoon’s vetos to stop resulting investigations</a>)and <a
      href="https://www.koreatimes.co.kr/southkorea/politics/20240412/yoons-critics-within-conservative-bloc-gain-greater-footing-after-surviving-elections">intra-party
      fighting</a> meant that the PPP and Yoon got their butts handed to them in
    the 2024 legislative elections. Even though the DPK’s win was big, it didn’t
    meet the requirements to overcome his veto or impeach Yoon. Despite that,
    the DPK continued to push for investigations into his wife’s scandals and
    other top officials, and moved to impeach <a
      href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10012166">some of those top
      officials</a>. Yoon’s relationship with opposition legislators was
    described as “<a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2024/12/03/world/asia/south-korea-yoon-martial-law.html">toxic</a>”,
    as he genuinely believed that his opposition was filled with “Marxists” <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/articles/c86py30qezvo">according to one of
      his close confidants at the time</a>. While the formal declaration of
    martial law was a shock to the world, <a
      href="https://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_national/1157003.html">it
      wasn’t completely unexpected</a>. He was stubborn, convinced his
    opposition was being controlled by communists, and deeply unpopular, with
    his approval rating plummeting from 53% at his inauguration to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Opinion_polling_on_the_Yoon_Suk_Yeol_presidency">20%
      shortly before December 3rd</a>. <a
      href="https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2025/jun/08/trump-la-protests-enemy-within">What
      else would a man like that do</a>? </p>
  <p><strong>What happened next?</strong> </p>
  <p>After multiple attempts, the DPK managed to <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impeachment_of_Yoon_Suk_Yeol">impeach
      Yoon Suk Yeol</a> on December 14th, 2024. Yoon was suspended and replaced
    by the Prime Minister Han Duck-soo, and would be fully removed from office
    pending a ruling from the Constitutional Court. Court proceedings began 2
    days later, on December 16th. The ruling wouldn’t come for months, and in
    the meantime <a

      would break out</a>, <a

      were held by groups both supporting and against Yoon</a>, and probably
    most importantly; a by-election (special election held to fill a vacancy in
    a specific office that has become vacant <em>between</em> general elections)
    would be held on <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/2025_South_Korean_by-elections">April
      2nd, 2025</a>. The pan-progressive voting bloc, which includes the DPK,
    won these elections in a landslide victory, which may have been a sign of
    things to come. 2 days later, on April 4th, the Constitutional <a
      href="https://www.bbc.com/news/live/c5yrpvggyyet">Court would uphold the
      impeachment</a>, and Yoon would be formally removed from office. 4 days
    after that, on April 8th, acting President Han Duck-soo declared a snap
    election to occur on June 3rd, 2025. The DPK would nominate Lee Jae-Myung,
    the candidate who lost to Yoon in 2022, as their candidate. The PPP would
    put up <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-election-conservative-party-nominated-kim-moon-503473489b9daeb3785ab3ff9d5dee8e">Kim
      Moon Soo</a> as theirs. And then take him down. And then put him back up
    after failing to <a
      href="https://apnews.com/article/south-korea-election-conservative-party-candidates-cc3141d0582486c6199b62f25d37445a">secure
      enough votes</a> to nullify the primary and replace him with <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Han_Duck-soo">Han Duck-soo</a>, who
    declared the snap election in the first place, but had resigned as interim
    president in order to run. The PPP and South Korean politics were in chaos,
    but hopefully resolution was around the corner. </p>
  <p><strong>The snap election</strong></p>
  <p>On June 3rd, 2025, the snap election would take place. The martial law
    fiasco had been the centerpoint of the rhetoric leading up to the election,
    and understandably so. This election marked the highest turnout election
    since 1997, with 79.38% of the eligible voting population casting a ballot.
    Despite the increased turnout, the result didn’t take long. In the early
    hours of June 4th, Kim Moon Soo would concede and <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreans-vote-president-after-months-turmoil-triggered-by-martial-law-2025-06-02/">Lee
      Jae-Myung of the DPK would be the new president of South Korea</a>.
    Finally tallies would put the tallies at Lee - 49.4%, Kim - 41.2%. Overall,
    the PPP had a solid showing for a party in disarray, as there was a 3rd
    party conservative candidate, Lee Jun-seok of the Reform party, that took
    8.34% of the vote. Nonetheless, the DPK is now in control of both the
    National Assembly and the Presidency of South Korea. </p>

  <p><strong>So, what happens next?</strong></p>
  <p>As you can imagine, President Lee has some tough challenges in front of
    him. The unique circumstances that allowed him to take power loom large over
    the country. He’s given the right answers so far, <a
      href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10502357">promising robust
      reforms</a> to limit the president’s ability to declare martial law among
    other changes. His promise to “<a
      href="https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2025/6/4/south-koreas-lee-promises-to-heal-wounds-in-first-address-as-president">heal
      wounds</a>” means that despite the large majority, Lee will take a
    pragmatic approach to domestic policy. How this will affect the President’s
    ideas around things like his promises around instituting a <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-koreas-liberal-new-president-lee-jae-myung-vows-economic-revival-judgement-2025-06-03/">4.5
      day workweek</a> and other social welfare programs is yet to be seen. </p>
  <p>Despite his populist roots, he’s <a
      href="https://www.koreaherald.com/article/10470272">preached a pro-market
      approach so far</a>. Considering the country's recent economic instability
    due to previously listed events and <a
      href="https://pragmaticpapers.github.io/06/trumps-tariffs-cause-stocks-to-tumble/">Donald
      Trump’s previously covered tariffs</a>, this is probably prudent. However,
    Lee has quite the tightrope to walk. Progressive governments in Korea have
    typically been against working with Japan for some <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Japanese_colonial_empire">historical
      disputes</a>, to put it nicely. However, if they can manage to put aside
    their differences, <a
      href="https://eai.or.kr/new/en/news/notice_view.asp?intSeq=23112&amp;board=eng_eaiinmedia&amp;keyword_option=&amp;keyword=&amp;more=">there
      is a lot to be gained</a>. While things have been <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/south-korea-china-japan-agree-promote-regional-trade-trump-tariffs-loom-2025-03-30/">going
      better in the region as of late</a>, it’s delicate. South Korea can’t
    afford to lose the support of either the US or China, their two largest
    trading partners. With Trump’s 90 day pause on tariffs set to expire on July
    9th, the pressure is on. This not to even mention <a
      href="https://www.politico.com/newsletters/politico-nightly/2025/05/22/the-north-korea-russia-alliance-gets-tighter-00366472">North
      Korea’s blooming relationship with Russia</a>. Lee has promised to improve
    relationships with their Northern counterpart, but I’m not holding my breath
    for that war to end anytime soon. </p>
  <p>To conclude, South Korea is going to be a very interesting place to watch
    for the next 5 years. Lee may get off to a slow start, as he was put into
    office immediately and hasn’t even picked a full cabinet yet. But South
    Korea’s parallels to the USA’s situation domestically are tough to miss.
    Tasked with fixing a slowed economy, healing political divides, and solving
    a healthcare crisis, Lee may not have time to secure his footing before
    public opinion begins to sour. On a global level, if the country can
    successfully navigate a trade war and various diplomatic relationships, <a
      href="https://carnegieendowment.org/emissary/2025/06/lee-south-korea-president-foreign-policy?lang=en">South
      Korea may be in a prime position</a> to establish a foothold on a
    transitioning world stage for years to come. While President Lee <a
      href="https://www.reuters.com/world/asia-pacific/legal-challenges-facing-south-koreas-incoming-president-lee-jae-myung-2025-06-03/">may
      be anything but clean</a>, if he can navigate treacherous waters
    successfully, he could be a success story for the ages. <a
