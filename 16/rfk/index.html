  <p><strong>Synopsis</strong></p>
  <p>Robert F. Kennedy Jr , retired all sitting members of the Advisory
    Committee on Immunization Practices or ACIP on June 10th, 2025. The ACIP is
    a <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/about/index.html">federal advisory board
    </a>established in 1964, to provide recommendations on the use of vaccines
    in the US. The CDC uses this board to determine guidance for healthcare
    providers. Insurance companies also rely on the ACIP to determine which
    vaccines to include for coverage. The board normally has 15 members with
    expertise in various medical fields. Rules <a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/about/index.html">prohibit any members</a>
    from being employed or involved with employees of vaccine manufacturing
    companies or holding a patent for a vaccine.</p>
  <p>RFK alleged that <a
      href="https://www.wsj.com/opinion/rfk-jr-hhs-moves-to-restore-public-trust-in-vaccines-45495112?mod=Searchresults_pos6&amp;page=1#:~:text=The%20committee%20has%20been%20plagued%20with%20persistent%20conflicts%20of%20interest%20and%20has%20become%20little%20more%20than%20a%20rubber%20stamp%20for%20any%20vaccine.">conflicts
      of interests</a> of the current board members compromised public trust. He
    relied on a <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5323771?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=The%20errors%20and,2009%20to%202012.">2000
      investigation</a> conducted by the House that, he states, reported that
    the conflict of interest rules were weak to non-existent. The report focuses
    on conflicts of interest specific to a 1997 rotavirus vaccine that was
    revoked after 13 months due to adverse reactions reported. </p>
  <p>He cited a 2009 investigation done by the HHS Inspector General on all
    special government employees that worked on advisory committees. The report
    states that 97% of the conflict of interest forms had omission. This is
    easily refuted by the interviews from members at the time which state that
    nearly all issues were clerical, and only <a
      href="https://www.npr.org/transcripts/nx-s1-5323771?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=That%203%25%20represents%20the%20proportion%20of%20all%20CDC%20committee%20members%20who%20voted%20on%20issues%20they%20were%20supposed%20to%20recuse%20themselves%20from%20in%202007.">3%
      of those errors</a> were issues that should have warranted recusal. </p>
  <p>RFK also stated that since many were nominated by Biden, late into his
    term, that there would not be an opportunity for Trump to nominate any until
    2028. However, there was one member whose <a
      href="https://web.archive.org/web/20250415170358/https://www.cdc.gov/acip/membership/roster.html">term
      ended in 2023, three members with terms ending in 2025, and three members
      with terms ending in 2027.</a></p>
  <p>RFK did not provide any specific examples of how members of the ACIP had
    conflicts of interest. There have been no reports of any financial
    relationships between vaccine providers and current ACIP members. While
    several members had prior affiliations with manufacturers, these were
    disclosed, and recusals were documented in meeting minutes as required by
    committee policy. As an example, <a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/acip/disclosures/by-member.html">Yvonne
      Maldonado</a>, recused herself from COVID-19 votes involving Pfizer in the
    June ‘24 meeting, as it overlapped with her research trials at Stafford.
    That relationship ceased by the October ‘24 meeting, where she discloses the
    connection during roll call, but continues to participate in votes on those
    vaccines.</p>

    needed to rebuild public trust. Critics state many of the proposed members
    are proponents of vaccine misinformation that will further <a

      public trust</a>.</p>
  <p>It should be noted that the ACIP does not approve vaccines for use, but
    simply provides recommendations for who should receive vaccines already
    approved by the FDA.</p>
  <p><strong>How the media reports the issue </strong></p>
  <p><strong> </strong>Depending on the media you frequent, you may only get one
    perspective. This can leave people perplexed about why other people have the
    beliefs or reactions they do to what may seem like an obvious story. </p>

  <p> Right wing media focuses on times when the system has made a mistake, the
    new experts that have questioned the current system, and processes in place.
    Due to the lack of trust in authority structures in place, perceived gate
    keeping of information and access to prominent positions, right wing media
    has finally been able to position itself in the highest rungs of leadership
    to prioritize its goals. </p>
  <p> Left wing media largely focuses on established experts and reports that,
    while mistakes have been made, there are constant improvements being made to
    address concerns from the public. Even as figures that misrepresent the
    complicated matters are growing more prominent. </p>
  <p><strong>My (very biased) take</strong></p>
  <p>Vaccine skepticism has existed <a

    promotes or mandates one. These movements were generally not successful
    because the diseases being combatted were severe. Smallpox had a <a

      mortality rate </a>and often left survivors scarred. The mortality rate
    for polio was<a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/pinkbook/hcp/table-of-contents/chapter-18-poliomyelitis.html#:~:text=Bulbospinal%20polio%2C%20a%20combination%20of,to%2075%25%20with%20bulbar%20involvement.">
      only 2%-5%</a> but the country was gripped by images of people placed in
    iron lungs to <a
      href="https://www.paho.org/en/stories/history-polio-eradication-re-emergence#:~:text=During%20the%20height%20of%20the,on%20to%20find%20a%20vaccine.">aid
      breathing and 1 in 200</a> infections led to irreversible paralysis. </p>
  <p>These early vaccine campaigns earned broad public trust because the stakes
    were visible and terrifying, but until recently, we lived in a time where
    deaths from diseases like measles weren't part of living memory. From
    2006-2017, no one died from measles, mumps, or rubella, yet <a
      href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/National_Vaccine_Injury_Compensation_Program?utm_source=chatgpt.com#:~:text=MMR%20(Measles%2C%20mumps,120">120
      claims were awarded</a> for MMR vaccine injuries. The HPV vaccine combats
    a cancer diagnosis that people would not see for <a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/hpv/about/cancers-caused-by-hpv.html#:~:text=Cancer%20usually%20takes%20years%2C%20even%20decades%2C%20to%20develop%20after%20a%20person%20gets%20HPV">years
      or decades</a>. Because vaccination is so widespread and effective, some
    risks of vaccination—however rare—feels more tangible than the diseases
    themselves.</p>
  <p>Of course, these numbers are only possible because vaccines are so
    successful. Without vaccines, thousands of people would have died from
    measles, mumps, and rubella. Cervical cancer kills <a
      href="https://www.cdc.gov/cervical-cancer/statistics/index.html#:~:text=What%20to%20know,women%20die%20of%20this%20cancer.">4,000
      women a year</a> even though nearly all cases are preventable if women
    avoid the very contagious HPV virus. The math is clear—but people often hate
    and avoid math. If understanding a policy requires statistics or
    probabilities, many will simply opt out.</p>
  <p>People like RFK are right about one thing: public trust in medical
    institutions has eroded. It is also true that people like RFK have helped
    erode it. But the problem is bigger than misinformation. We have become
    victims of our own success. Public apathy is the cost of a job too well
    done—when you’ve never seen the disease, you do not see the need for the
    shot. </p>
  <p>Trust in institutions matters. If the public cannot do all the science
    themselves—which they cannot—we need experts we can believe. RFK’s new team
    does not offer that. They have spent years sowing distrust. Now we are
    supposed to believe they will rebuild it?</p>
  <p>One of the replacements named for the ACIP is Robert Malone, a known
    vaccine skeptic that became prevalent during COVID questioning the vaccine
    while claiming he invented the <a
      href="https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/03/technology/robert-malone-covid.html">technology
      that was used to develop it</a>. Many others named to the panel have
    denounced the COVID vaccine or made a name as leading sources of
    misinformation on vaccines. RFK has stated there are no safe and effective
    vaccines and that HIV doesn’t cause AIDs.</p>
  <p>This new panel doesn’t look like a repair crew—it looks like a hostile
    takeover. They have not earned the public’s trust. They have weaponized its
    absence. They will not be able to win over skeptics any more than Trump
    could—remember, <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eA306aNtvmk">he was
      booed</a> by his own supporters for backing the COVID vaccine.</p>

  <p>These people do not trust the system because it is complicated and they do
    not understand it, but it does not become any simpler when it comes out of
    RFK’s mouth. He is just making it angrier. In the process, he is turning off
    the very people who still believe in our institutions.</p>
  <p>If I am honest, at this point, I hope the system blows up. Not because I do
    not believe in it, but because some people need to see the consequences to
    understand why we had vaccines in the first place. Moving into a world where
    vaccines are optional, will make those consequences visible again, and
    probably thin out some of the anti-vax crowd dragging all of us down.</p>
