  <p>This report is only a summary and editorial regarding the executive orders
    (“EOs”) signed by the Trump Administration during the last week. EOs are not
    legislation or court opinions. They do not carry the weight of law, and are
    merely statements of policy within the executive branch. That is not to say
    they cannot be cited in court or legal pleadings, or aren’t relevant to the
    application of law, only that they are almost never controlling outside of
    internal executive branch administration.</p>
  <p>EOs are signed and reported on, generally, a week before they are published
    into the Federal Register. Until such a publication, it can be difficult to
    know the exact language of the signed EO. For that reason, these reports
    only include EOs published in the Federal Register. While this can lead to
    these reports feeling delayed or dated, it is to ensure precision and
    clarity.</p>

      Order 14304 Leading the World in Supersonic Flight</a></p>
  <p>Signed: June 6, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: June 11, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 talks about how US regulations have held back aerospace
    innovation.</p>
  <p>Section 2 orders the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
    (FAA) to take repeal the prohibition on overland supersonic flight and
    establish a new noise-based certification standard.</p>
  <p>Section 3 orders the Director of the Office of Science and Technology
    Policy to consult with heads of departments and agencies to coordinate
    supersonic research and development, focusing on commercial viability of
    supersonic aircraft.</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders the Secretary of Transportation and other executive
    officers to engage the International Civil Aviation Organization to seek
    global alignment regarding supersonic regulatory approaches.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is targeted on commercial supersonic air travel. Since the
    scuttling of the Concorde planes in the last century, there have been no
    commercially available supersonic flights. Recently there has been renewed
    interest from the private sector, so this is likely the result of their
    influence on this Administration.</p>

  </div>
  <p>US airline United has announced plans to buy 15 new supersonic airliners
    and "return supersonic speeds to aviation" in the year 2029.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>It is possible that this will actually result in a supersonic commercial
    aircraft anytime soon. There are multiple issues with supersonic commercial
    travel, and little demand for this level of speed. This may result in some
    slight developments in the industry, but likely will just adjust regulations
    around supersonic travel, and leave a wake of wasted investor money.</p>

      Order 14305 Restoring American Airspace Sovereignty</a></p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 discusses the recent innovation of drones, and how America needs
    to catch up to the rest of the world.</p>
  <p>Section 2 creates definitions for the EO.</p>
  <p>Section 3 states it is US policy to ensure control over our national
    airspace.</p>
  <p>Section 4 establishes the Federal Task Force to Restore American Airspace
    Sovereignty to be chaired by the Assistant to the President for National
    Security Affairs. It will review relevant operational, technical, and
    regulatory frameworks and develop solutions to potential drone threats.</p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the Administrator of the Federal Aviation Administration
    to restrict drones near secure sites and critical infrastructure, and other
    related regulations.</p>
  <p>Section 6 orders the AG and the Administrator of the FAA to ensure full
    enforcement of the laws currently on the books against drone operators
    acting outside the law.</p>
  <p>Section 7 orders law enforcement to track and identify drones and drone
    signals. </p>
  <p>Section 8 orders various executive officials to coordinate and determine if
    airports, military facilities, and other important sites require increased
    security against drones.</p>
  <p>Section 9 orders the Secretary of Defense and Secretary of DHS to
    collaborate in evaluating whether or not to integrate counter potential
    drone attacks.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is one of the two times this broken clock Administration has been
    correct. Drones, especially small civilian ones, pose a serious threat.
    Ukraine and Israel have shown how devastating a well coordinated and
    operated set of drones can be. This EO intends to begin the process of
    adapting American security to incorporate threats from drones.</p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>This EO is a bit too vague to easily project its fall out. It is possible
    that this actually begins a process to help prevent drone attacks. It’s
    equally possible that it simply removes some regulations, and there is
    little action domestically to address potential threats from drones.</p>

      Order 14306 Sustaining Select Efforts To Strengthen the Nation’s
      Cybersecurity and Amending EO 13694 and EO 14144</a></p>
  <p>Signed: June 6, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: June 13, 2025</p>
  <p>This EO relies on the <a
      href="https://www.congress.gov/congressional-report/110th-congress/senate-report/82">International
      Economic Emergency Powers Act</a> (the “IEEPA”), the <a
      href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?path=/prelim@title50/chapter34&amp;edition=prelim">National
      Emergencies Act</a> (the “NEA”), the <a
      href="https://www.govinfo.gov/content/pkg/COMPS-10384/pdf/COMPS-10384.pdf">Trade
      Act of 1974 § 604</a>, and <a
      href="https://uscode.house.gov/view.xhtml?req=(title:3%20section:301%20edition:prelim)">3
      USC 301</a>.</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Sections 1 and 2 lay out the changes to be made to <a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2025/01/17/2025-01470/strengthening-and-promoting-innovation-in-the-nations-cybersecurity">EO
      14144</a>, it makes a lot of very specific changes that I, frankly, do not
    understand because I don’t know anything about cybersecurity.</p>
  <p>Section 3 amends <a
      href="https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2015/04/02/2015-07788/blocking-the-property-of-certain-persons-engaging-in-significant-malicious-cyber-enabled-activities">EO
      13694</a> to target foreign people specifically.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means &amp; Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>I don’t really know. Here is an article discussing it better than I ever
    could.</p>

      Order 14307 Unleashing American Drone Dominance</a></p>
  <p>Signed: June 6, 2025</p>
  <p>Published: June 13, 2025</p>
  <p><strong>Summary</strong></p>
  <p>Section 1 talks about how important drones are.</p>
  <p>Section 2 lays out definitions for the EO.</p>
  <p>Section 3 states it is the US policy to promote drone production and
    integration domestically.</p>
  <p>Section 4 orders the Secretary of Transportation and the Administrator of
    the Federal Aviation Administration to establish rules enabling routine
    Beyond Visual Line of Sight operations for commercial drones and public
    safety purposes. </p>
  <p>Section 5 orders the Administrator of the FAA to publish a roadmap for
    integration of civilian drones into the National Airspace System.</p>
  <p>Section 6 orders the creation of an electric Vertical Takeoff and Landing
    Pilot Program.</p>
  <p>Section 7 orders all agencies to prioritize the integration of drones
    manufactured in the US over those made abroad.</p>
  <p>Section 8 orders various executive officials to amend export control
    regulations to enable the export of US manufactured civil drones.</p>
  <p>Section 9 orders the Secretary of Defense to ensure that drone
    manufacturing, integration, and procurement is prioritized.</p>
  <p><strong>What It Means</strong></p>
  <p>As with EO 14305 this is focused on drones, though now from the perspective
    of US operators. It is attempting to integrate drones and their use
    commercially into the regulatory scheme of the federal government. </p>
  <p><strong>Looking Forward</strong></p>
  <p>It is possible that this opens the door for drone delivery, and other drone
    companies to expand and make a lot of money. Drones have been a high
    priority for the US for years, and while this EO is not entirely redundant,
    it’s unclear how this is markedly different from precious administrations’
    stance of the use and integration of Drones.</p>
