      Thursday, DGG began its infiltration of the Yonkers Young Dems.
      Accompanied by one of my trusty NY squad members, we seamlessly slipped
      among their ranks and participated in one of their weekly meetings. First,
      we were greeted by the President of the Young Dems, John Santos. Within
      minutes he was revealing all sorts of strategies and secrets of the New
      York democratic scene. George Latimer looking for federal employees
      affected by DOGE, an “Empty Chair” town hall featuring the ghost of
      Republican Congressman Michael Lawler, the dates and locations of more
      canvassing events; you name it, John was spilling it. He even let it slip
      that he was the MAYOR’S SON. Before I had time to process the treasure
      trove of information I had just received, the meeting started. During the
      open discussion portion, I was able to push back on some of the more
      extreme subjects, such as packing the courts and doomerism. In the time it
      took to play 3 games of league, I had rubbed elbows with the democratic
      elite, disseminated DGG propaganda, and had clear next steps for our next
      operation. And I’d be lying if I said I didn’t have fun as well. After two
      hours and lots of laughs, I only had one thought; “It couldn’t possibly be
      this easy, right?”

      During the 2024 Canvassing Program, the number one lesson that we learned
      was the raw power of “Just showing up”. When we went to rallies, protests,
      meetings, etc., we were greeted with enthusiasm, eagerness, and what we
      thought was an abnormal amount of access. After attending public events,
      the Arizona team was able to sit down with their congressperson, the PA
      team spoke with the Mayor of Philly and Maxwell Frost, and the Nevada team
      got funding for multiple events AND get Representative Susie Lee to speak
      at the Las Vegas event. Everyone in the program who attended events was
      able to draw volunteers, make connections, meet a cool figure, and
      generally have a great time.

      Now listen, you might show up and find that the group isn’t a good match
      for you, or that it is too dense with speeches and fluff for you to
      connect with anyone there. You might not be ready to talk up the room the
      first time you walk into it. But you guarantee nothing interesting happens
      if you decide to stay home. Every single time you get your ass out into
      the world, you are making progress. You are building yourself up. You are
      giving yourself odds. You are taking the first step. And you are making a
      difference.

      This week, dozens of your fellow DGGas took that exact same first step.
      They joined the Political Discord and canvassed, attended rallies and
      meetings, and protested the rise of a dictator. You might have already
      seen their posts on reddit, and today I’m inviting you to do the same. In
      the words of the great Gavin Mcinnes; “Do something. You’re literally on
      your ass! Get up! Get up!”
