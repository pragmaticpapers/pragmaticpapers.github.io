              What are Democrats doing? Tesla boycott – definitely real,
              definitely legal. Or is it? Ukraine attempts to claw back after a
              chaotic couple of weeks as Russia ramps up the offensive. Elon and
              DOGE attempt to hide from accountability as courts step in. More
              of Trump's executive orders reviewed.

              Pressure mounts as public sentiment sours for the President. The

              Zelensky arrives at the White House – things don't go too well.
              Trump signs more unhinged executive orders. Is DOGE as popular as
              Elon claims? Polls seem to suggest otherwise. Maxwell Frost
              elected to Congress.
